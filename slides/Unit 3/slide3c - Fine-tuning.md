## Self-supervised learning

Self-supervised learning has emerged as a robust technique for training neural networks, particularly in the realm of language models. Unlike traditional supervised learning that relies on manual labeling of data, self-supervised learning leverages the inherent structure and patterns within the data itself to train models.

A typical language model is trained by the framework of next state prediction / next sentence (or word) prediction (NSP). This prediction task can be represented as a Bayes (conditional probability) problem: $P(w_t | w_1, \dots, w_{t-1})$, where the model calculates the probability of the next word ($w_t$) based on a given set of preceding words ($w_1, \dots, w_{t-1}$).

To make it clear, we can categorize self-supervised learning data into two classes based on their role in the learning process.
- 1. Current state data:
	- We might locate a pointer on the primary data or input that the model needs to make predictions about.
	- For text data, it could be a part of the text sequence.
	- For time series data, it could be the latest value / price of the time series. 
	- For video, the current state data might be the last frame of the video.
- 2. Nearby data (context):
	- For text data, nearby data might be other words or sentences in the same document.
	- For time series data, it could be the  value / price in the past of the current state.
	- For video, nearby data might be previous frames that plays before the last frame of the video.
- Self-supervised learning tries to iteratively feed-forward different pairs of "current state data and nearby data" to train the neural network model. 
## Structure of neural network in language learning 

1. **Input Layer (Word Embeddings)**: The input layer will be your pre-trained word embeddings. The size of these embeddings typically ranges from 50 to 300 dimensions. For instance, GloVe provides embeddings of various dimensions, and BERT uses 768-dimensional embeddings.
2. **Hidden Layers**: The choice and number of hidden layers depend on your specific task. Here are a few examples:
   - For text classification:
	   - you might use one or two Dense layers after a `GlobalMaxPooling` or `GlobalAveragePooling` layer to reduce the sequence dimension.
   - For sequence labeling tasks:
	   - (like named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging)
	   - you could use a Bidirectional LSTM or GRU layer.
   - For more complex tasks 
	     like machine translation or question answering
	     you might use a stack of several LSTM/GRU layers, or even a transformer architecture.
   The size of these layers (number of units) can range widely, but common choices are in the range of 64-512 units.
3. **Output Layer**: The output layer will depend on your specific task:
   - For binary classification, you would use a single unit with a sigmoid activation function.
   - For multi-class classification, you would use a softmax activation function with as many units as there are classes.
   - For sequence labeling, you could use a Dense layer with a softmax activation and a number of units equal to the number of labels.

## What is fine tuning?



![](../../Pasted%20image%2020231115061758.png)
## General steps of fine-tuning a pre-trained embeddings for our specific dataset:
- 1. Prepare your dataset (labels and values)
- 2. Split test set and train set
- 3. Use pre-trained tokenizer and pre-trained sequence classification BERT from huggingface
- 4. Use TrainerAPI provided by huggingface to train the model 
	- specify training and testing dataset
- 5. Evaluate, predict, confusion matrix, save model

# Details of each steps

## Preparing Your Dataset

The first step of fine-tuning a pre-trained model is to prepare your dataset. This involves:

- Collecting data relevant to your task. This could be tweets for sentiment analysis, academic papers for named entity recognition, or conversation logs for intent detection, among others.
- Labeling the data accordingly. This could involve tagging each tweet with its sentiment, annotating parts of the academic papers with the entities they refer to, or marking each conversation log with the detected intent.
- Preprocessing the data, which may include cleaning (removing irrelevant symbols or stop words), normalizing (lower-casing, stemming), and tokenizing the text. Remember that some models, like BERT, require specific formatting, so ensure you adhere to these requirements.

## Splitting the Dataset

Once your dataset is ready, it's necessary to divide it into distinct subsets: training, validation, and testing sets. A typical split might be 70% for training, 15% for validation (used during the training process to prevent overfitting), and 15% for testing. However, the exact ratio may vary based on your dataset size and the specific requirements of your task.

## Using Pre-trained Models

Hugging Face's transformers library is a treasure trove of pre-trained models ready for fine-tuning. You can choose a model suitable for your task, such as BERT for sequence classification or GPT-2 for text generation. Remember to pair the model with the corresponding pre-trained tokenizer, which will convert your text data into a format the model can understand, including turning words into tokens, and tokens into unique IDs.

## Training the Model

With your data prepared and your pre-trained model selected, you're now ready to start training. Hugging Face's `Trainer` API simplifies this process. Here's what you need to do:

- Specify your training and validation datasets.
- Set hyperparameters like the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. These control the pace of learning, the amount of data processed at once, and the number of times the model will iterate over the entire dataset, respectively.
- Define a training configuration (`TrainingArguments`) where you specify the training parameters and the location to save the model.
- Create a `Trainer` instance with the model, training configuration, and datasets.
- Call the `train` method to start the training process.

## Evaluating the Model

After your model has been trained, it's time to evaluate its performance. This involves using the unseen test set to make predictions and comparing those predictions to the actual labels. Depending on your task, you might use different metrics:

- Accuracy: Useful for balanced classification tasks.
- Precision, Recall, and F1 score: Helpful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
- Mean squared error or R-squared: Used for regression tasks.

A confusion matrix can provide a comprehensive overview of your model's performance, showing the frequency of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.

## Saving and Reusing the Model

Once you're satisfied with your model's performance, you can save it for later use. Hugging Face provides simple functions (`save_model` and `from_pretrained`) for saving and loading models, allowing you to easily reuse your fine-tuned model on new data in the future.

## Conclusion

Fine-tuning pre-trained models provides a powerful way to customize these high-performing models to your specific task. However, it requires careful data preparation, thoughtful hyperparameter selection, and diligent performance evaluation to ensure optimal results. With this enriched guide, you're now well-equipped to fine-tune your own pre-trained model for your specific dataset and task.
