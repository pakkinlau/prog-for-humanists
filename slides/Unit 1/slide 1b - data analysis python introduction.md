Data analytics - Objects to learn:
- Numpy:
	- 
- Pandas
	- 1D - Series - A series with associated index
	- 2D - Dataframe

Tips for learning a new package effectively:
- 1. Get high-quality resource
- 2. Get demonstration code for its smallest unit if it is available 
- 3. Subsetting the area of coverage that you might find it useful
- 4. Read code snippet line-by-line and discover the part that you do not familiar with
- 5. Create a Jupyter notebook that test-running and showcasing the code running result of each module

Discussion
- 1. Can you outline what are the models that the packages involved? 
- 1. How the lines of code incorporating with 

Exercise 1: 
- Depict the "model" involved in numpy and pandas by drawing and descriptions
- Typically you need to update your model a plenty of time before it becomes an accurate representation

Exercise 2: 
- Decide a data analytics task you want to try on
- Find similar existing snippets from the internet
- Try to summarize the snippet and decompose it into multiple steps
- Create a Jupyter notebook that test-running and showcasing the code running result of each module
- Put the "model" you have written in exercise 1 back into the Jupyter notebook.
