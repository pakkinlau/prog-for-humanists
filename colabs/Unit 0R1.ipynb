It serves as a base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch. By inheriting from `nn.Module`, we leverage the extensive functionalities and optimizations that PyTorch offers for neural network implementations.\n","    - The parameters `input_size`, `hidden_size`, and `num_classes` are essential. Defining them in the constructor enforces users to specify these values when creating an instance of the `SimpleNN` class. `input_size` represents the number of features in the input data, `hidden_size` denotes the number of neurons in the hidden layer, and `num_classes` indicates the number of classes in the classification task.\n","    - Within the `SimpleNN` class, we define the neural network architecture using pre-built PyTorch modules. `nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)` creates a linear transformation layer, mapping the input features to the hidden layer. The `nn.ReLU()` activation function introduces non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns. Finally, `nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)` maps the hidden layer to the output layer, producing predictions for each class.\n","\n","\n","2. **Information Hiding:**\n","   - Information hiding is a principle that encourages restricting the access to certain parts of an object and preventing the details of its implementation from being visible to the outside world. While this script does not explicitly demonstrate information hiding, the use of classes and modules in more complex programs adheres to this principle.\n","\n","3. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**\n","   - SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should only have one job or responsibility. In this script, the `SimpleNN` class adheres to the SRP. It defines a neural network, and its responsibility is clear: handling the network's architecture and forward pass logic.\n","\n","4. **Coupling:**\n","   - Coupling refers to the degree to which one class or module depends on another. Low coupling is generally preferred, as it indicates that changes in one module will have minimal impact on other modules. In this script, the components are relatively decoupled: the neural network class, the loss function, and the optimizer are separate entities.\n","\n","5. **DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself):**\n","   - The DRY principle is followed in this script. For instance, the code for defining the neural network architecture, training the model, and testing the model is not repeated.
