SIR ROBERT CUNLIFFE, BART., C.B.,                                       OF     ACTON PARK, DENBIGHSHIRE, LATE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF THE BENGAL ARMY,     IN WHOSE DEPARTMENT THE AUTHOR HAD FOR SOME YEARS THE HONOUR TO SERVE,                                THIS LITTLE WORK          IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED, AS A MARK OF HIS SINCERE ESTEEM.                                          PREFACE.      Good wine, says the proverb, needs no bush; on the same principle, some  will think that a book, if readable, may dispense with a preface. As a  general rule this may be true, but there are occasions, and I take leave  to deem this one of them, when, from the peculiar nature of the subject,  a few preliminary observations, by creating a clear and possibly a  pleasant understanding between the author and the gentle reader, may not  be unacceptable or out of place. In the following little narrative, in  which I have blended fact and fictionâthough always endeavouring to keep  the _vraisemblable_ in viewâmy object has been to depict some of those  scenes, characters, and adventures, which some five-and-twenty or thirty  years ago a âjolly cadetââalias a Griffinâwas likely to encounter,  during the first year of his military career; men, manners, and things  in general have, since that period, undergone considerable changes;  still, in its main features, the sketch I have drawn, admitting its  original correctness, will doubtless apply as well to Griffins in the  present mature age of the century, as when it was in its teens. The  Griffin, or Greenhorn, indeed, though subject, like everything else, to  the external changes incident to time and fashion, is, perhaps,  fundamentally and essentially, one of the ânever ending, still  beginningâ states, or phases of humanity, destined to exist till the  âcrash of doom.â    The characters which I have introduced in my narrative (for the most  part as transiently as the fleeting shadows of a magic lantern across a  spectrum) are all intended to represent respectively classes having more  or less of an Oriental stamp, some still existing unchangedâothers on  the waneâand a few, I would fain hope, who, like the Trunnions and  Westerns (_parva componere magnis_) of the last age have wholly  disappeared before the steadily increasing light of knowledge and  civilizationâinfluences destructive of those coarse humours, narrow  prejudices, and eccentric traits, which, however amusing in the pages of  the novelist, are wondrously disagreeable in real life. It is true, the  gradual disappearance of these coarser features imposes on the painter  of life and manners the necessity of cultivating a nicer perceptionâof  working with a finer pencil, and of seizing and embodying the now less  obvious indications of the feelings and passionsâthe more delicate  lights and shades of mind and characterâbut still in parting in a great  measure with the materials for coarse drollery and broad satire, the  world perhaps on the whole will be a gainer; higher feelings will be  addressed than those which minister to triumph and imply humiliation:  for though âtis well to laugh at folly and expose itââtwere perhaps  better to have no folly or error to laugh at and expose.    In the following pages, my wish has been to amuse, and where I  couldâwithout detriment to the professedly light and jocular character  of the workâto instruct and improve. To hurt or offend has never entered  into my contemplationâif such could ever be my object, I should not do  it under a mask.    I deem it necessary to make this observation _en passant_, lest, like a  young officer I once heard of in India, who, conscience-stricken on  hearing some of his besetting sins, as he thought, pointedly denounced,  flung out of the church, declaring âthere was no standing the chaplainâs  personalities,â some of my readers should think that I have been taking,  under cover, a sly shot at themselves or friends. That the characters  lightly sketched in these Memoirs have been taken from lifeâ_i.e._, that  the ideas of them have been furnished by real personagesâI in some  measure candidly allow, though I have avoided making the portraits  invidiously exact; as in a dream, busy fancy weaves a tissue of events  out of the stored impressions of the brain, so, of course, the writer of  a story must in like manner, though with more congruity, arrange and  embody his scattered recollections, though not necessarily in the exact  shape and order in which the objects, &c., originally presented  themselves. Moreover, I believe I may safely add, that the originals of  my sketches have, for the most part, long since brought âlifeâs fitful  feverâ to a close.    To the kind care of the public I now consign the âGriffin,â particularly  to that portion of it connected with India, a country where my best days  have been spent, the scene of some of my happiest hours, as alas! of my  severest trials and bereavements; hoping, on account of his âyouth,â  they will take him under their especial protection. To the critics I  also commend him, trusting, if they have âany bowels,â that they will,  for the same reason, deal with him tenderly.    Londonâqueen of cities!âon sympathetic grounds, I hope for your  munificent patronage. Griffins[1] are your supporters, then why not  support my âGriffin?â    If encouraged by the smiles of a âdiscriminating public,â I may, at some  future period, impart the late Brevet Captain Gernonâs post-griffinish  experiences amongst Burmahs, Pindaries, and âChimeras dire,â with his  âimpressions of home,â as contained in the remaining autobiography of  that lamented gentleman, who sunk under a gradual decay of nature and a  schirrous liver, some time during the last hot summer.    It is proper I should state that these Memoirs, in a somewhat different  form, first saw the light in the pages of the _Asiatic Journal_.

CHAPTER I.      Pleasant days of my Griffinhood!âgreen oasis of lifeâs desert  waste!âthoughtless, joyous, happy season, when young Hope told âher  flattering tale,â and novelty broke sweetly upon a heart unsated by the  world, with what fond and regretful emotions do I now look back upon you  through the long, dim, dreary vista of five-and-twenty years!    But I think I hear a raw reader exclaim, âGriffins!âare there griffins  in the East?â âAssuredly, sir. Did you never hear of the law of  Zoroaster quoted in _Zadig_, by which griffinsâ flesh is prohibited to  be eaten? Griffins are so common at the different presidencies of India  that nobody looks at them, and most of these animals are very tame.â I  will not, however, abuse the travellerâs privilege.    _Griffin_, or more familiarly a _Griff_, is an Anglo-Indian cant term  applied to all new-comers, whose lot has been cast in the âgorgeous  East.â Whether the appellation has any connection with the fabulous  compound, the gryps or gryphon of armorial blazoning, is a point which I  feel myself incompetent to decide.[2] A griffin is the Johnny Newcome of  the East, one whose European manners and ideas stand out in ludicrous  relief when contrasted with those, so essentially different in most  respects, which appertain to the new country of his sojourn. The  ordinary period of griffinhood is a year, by which time the _novus  homo_, if apt, is supposed to have acquired a sufficient familiarity  with the language, habits, customs, and manners of the country, both  Anglo-Indian and Native, so as to preclude his making himself supremely  ridiculous by blunders, _gaucheries_, and the indiscriminate application  of English standards to states of things to which those rules are not  always exactly adapted. To illustrate by example:âa good-natured  Englishman, who should present a Brahmin who worships the cow with a  bottle of beef-steak sauce, would be decidedly âgriffinish,â  particularly if he could be made acquainted with the nature of the gift;  nevertheless, beef steak, _per se_, is an excellent thing in an  Englishmanâs estimation, and a better still with the addition of the  before-mentioned condiment. But to return to our subject.    At the termination, then, of the above-mentioned period, our griffin, if  he has made the most of his time, becomes entitled to associate on  pretty equal terms with those sun-dried specimens of the _genus homo_,  familiarly called the âold hands:ââsubs of fifteen yearsâ standing;  grey-headed captains, and superannuated majors, critics profound in the  merits of a curry, or the quality of a batch of Hodgsonâs pale ale. He  ceases to be the butt of his regiment, and persecutes in his turn, with  the zeal of a convert, all novices not blessed with his modicum of local  experience.    Youth is proverbially of a plastic nature, and the juvenile griffin,  consequently, in the majority of instances, readily accommodates himself  to the altered circumstances in which he is placed; but not so the man  of mature years, to whose moral and physical organization forty or fifty  winters have imparted their rigid and unmalleable influences. Griffins  of this description, which commonly comprises bishops, judges,  commanders-in-chief, and gentlemen sent out on special missions, &c.,  protract their griffinage commonly during the whole period of their stay  in the country, and never acquire the peculiar knowledge which entitles  them to rank with the initiated. The late most excellent Bishop Heber,  for example, who to the virtues of a Christian added all the qualities  which could adorn the scholar and gentleman, was nevertheless an  egregious griffin, as a perusal of his delightful travels in India,  written in all the singleness of his benevolent heart, must convince any  one acquainted with the character of the country and the natives of  India.    Autobiographers love to begin _ab ovo_, and I see no reason why I should  wholly deviate from a custom doubly sanctioned by reason and established  usage. It is curious sometimes to trace the gradual development of  character in âsmallâ as well as in âgreatâ men; to note the little  incidents which often determine the nature of our future career, and  describe the shootings of the young idea at that vernal season when they  first begin to expand into trees of good or evil. In an old manor-house,  not thirty miles from London, on a gloomy November day, I first saw the  light. Of the home of my infancy I remember little but my nursery, a  long, bare, whitewashed apartment, with a tall, diamond-paned window,  half obscured by the funereal branches of a venerable yew-tree. This  window looked out, I remember, on the village churchyard, thickly  studded with the moss-grown memorials of successive generations. In that  window-seat I used to sit for many a weary hour, watching the boys  idling on the gravestones, the jackdaws wheeling their airy circles  round the spire, or the parsonâs old one-eyed horse cropping the rank  herbage, which sprouted fresh and green above the silent dust of many a  âvillage Hampden.â The recollections of infancy, like an old picture,  become often dim and obscure, but here and there particular events, like  bright lights and rich Rembrandt touches, remain deeply impressed, which  seem to defy the effects of time; of this kind is a most vivid  recollection I have of a venerable uncle of my motherâs, an old Indian,  who lived with us, and whose knee I always sought when I could give  nurse the slip. My great uncle Frank always welcomed me to his little  _sanctum_ in the green parlour, and having quite an Arabâs notion of the  sacred rights of hospitality, invariably refused to give me up when  nurse, puffing and foaming, would waddle in to reclaim me. I shall never  forget the delight I derived from his pleasant stories and the white  sugar-candy, of which he always kept a stock on hand. Good old man! he  died full of years, and was the first of a long series of friends whose  loss I have had to lament.    My father was, truly, that character emphatically styled âan Irish  gentleman,â in whom the suavity of the Frenchman was combined with much  of the fire and brilliancy of his native land. Though of an ancient  family, his fortune, derived from an estate in the sister kingdom, was  very limited, the âdirty acresâ having somehow or other, from generation  to generation, become âsmall by degrees, and beautifully less.â He was  of a tender frame, and of that delicate, sensitive, nervous temperament,  which, though often the attendant on genius, which he unquestionably  possessed, little fits those so constituted to buffet with the world, or  long to endure its storms. He died in the prime of manhood, when I was  very young, and left my mother to struggle with those difficulties which  are always incident to a state of widowhood, with a numerous family and  a limited income. The deficiency of fortune was, however, in her case,  compensated by the energies of a masculine understanding, combined with  an untiring devotion to the interest and welfare of her children.    Trades and professions in England are almost as completely hereditary as  among the castes of India. The great Franklin derived his âponderous  strength,â physical if not intellectual, from a line of Blacksmiths, and  I, Frank Gernon, inherit certain atrabilious humours, maternally, from a  long series of very respectable âQui Hyes.â[3] Yes, my mothers  familyâfather, grandfather, uncles, and cousinsâhad all served with  exemplary fidelity that potent merchant-monarch affectionately termed in  India the Honourable John (though degraded, I am sorry to say, into an  âold womanâ by his native subjects); they had all flourished for more  than a century under the shade of the ârupee tree,â a plant of  Hesperidean virtues, whose fructiferous powers, alas! have since their  time sadly declined. These, my maternal progenitors, were men both of  the sword and pen; some had filled high civil stations with credit,  whilst others, under the banners of a Clive, a Lawrence, or a Munro, had  led âIndâs dusky chivalryâ to war, and participated in many of those  glorious, but now time-mellowed exploits, from which the splendid fabric  of our Eastern dominions has arisen. This, and other circumstances on  which I shall briefly touch, combined to point my destiny to the  gorgeous East. My mother, for the reasons given, and the peculiar  facilities which she consequently had for establishing us in that  quarter, had from an early period looked fondly to India as the theatre  for the future exertions of her sons. But long before the period of my  departure arrivedâindeed I may say almost from infancyâI had been  inoculated by my mother, my great uncle, and sundry parchment-faced  gentlemen who frequented our house, with a sort of Indo-mania. I was  never tired of hearing of its people, their manners, dress, &c., and was  perfectly read on the subject of alligators and Bengal tigers. I used,  indeed, regularly and systematically to persecute and bore every  Anglo-Indian that came in my way for authentic accounts of their history  and mode of destruction, &c. One most benevolent old gentleman, a fine  specimen of the Indian of other days, and a particular friend of my  family, used to âfool us to the top of our bentâ in that way. I say us,  for the Indo-mania was not confined to myself.    My mother, too, used to entertain us with her experiences, which served  to feed the ardent longing which I felt to visit the East. How often in  the winter evenings of pleasant âlang syne,â when the urn hissed on the  table, and the cat purred on the comfortable rug, has our then happy  domestic circle listened with delight to her account of that far-distant  land! What respect did the sonorous names of Bangalore and Cuddalore,  and Nundy Droog and Severn Droog, and Hookhaburdar and Soontaburdars,  and a host of others, excite in our young minds! In what happy  accordance with school-boy thoughts were the descriptions she gave us of  the fruits of that sunny climeâthe luscious mangoâthe huge jackâthe  refreshing guavaâand, above all, the delicious custard-apple, a  production which I never in the least doubted contained the exact  counterpart of that pleasant admixture of milk and eggs which daily  excited my longing eyes amongst the tempting display of a pastry-cookâs  window! Sometimes she rose to higher themes, in which the pathetic or  adventurous predominated. How my poor cousin Will fell by the dagger of  an assassin at the celebrated massacre of Patna; and how another  venturous relative shot a tiger on foot, thereby earning the  benedictions of a whole community of peaceful Hindoos, whose village had  long been the scene of his midnight maraudings: this story, by the way,  had a dash of the humorous in it, though relating in the main to a  rather serious affair. It never lost its raciness by repetition, and  whenever my mother told it, which at our request she frequently did, and  approached what we deemed the comic part, our risibles were always on  full-cock for a grand and simultaneous explosion of mirth.    Well, time rolled on; I had doubled the Cape of Good Hope, sweet  sixteen, and the ocean of life and adventure lay before me. I stood five  feet nine inches in my stockings, and possessed all the aspirations  common to my age. âFrank, my love,â one day said my mother to me, at the  conclusion of breakfast, âI have good news for you; that most benevolent  of men, Mr. Versanket, has complied with my application, and given me an  infantry cadetship for you; here,â she continued, âis his letter, read  it, and ever retain, as I trust you will, a lively sense of his  goodness.â I eagerly seized the letter, and read the contents with a  kind of ecstasy. It expressed sympathy in my mothers difficulties, and  an invitation to me to come to London and take advantage of his offer.    I will not dwell on the parting scenes. Suffice it to say, that I  embraced those dear objects of my affection, many of whom I was never  destined to embrace again, and bid a sorrowful long adieu to the  parental roof. I arrived in the great metropolis, and prepared for my  outfit and departure. Having completed the formerâsheets, ducks, jeans,  and gingerbread, tobacco to bribe old Neptune, brandy to mollify the  sailors, and all _et ceteras_, according to the most approved list of  Messrs. Welsh and Stalkerânought remained but to pass the India House,  an ordeal which I was led to view with an indefinable dread. From whom I  received the information I now forget, though it was probably from some  one of that mischievous tribe of jokers, who love to sport with the  feelings of youth; but I was told that it was absolutely necessary that  I should learn by heart, as an indispensable preliminary to passing, the  âArticles of War and Mutiny Act,â then forming one volume. What was my  state of alarm and despondency as I handled that substantial  yellow-backed tome, and reflected on the task I had to perform of  committing its whole contents to memory in the brief space of one week!  It haunted me in my dreams, and the thought of it, sometimes crossing my  mind whilst eating, almost suspended the power of swallowing. I carried  it about with me whereever I went, applying to it with desperate  determination whenever a leisure moment, of which I had very few, would  admit; but what I forced into my sensorium one moment, the eternal noise  and racket of London drove out of it the next. To cut a long story  short, the day arrived, âthe all-important day,â big with my fate. I  found myself waiting in the India House, preparatory to appearing before  the directors, and, saving the first two or three clauses, the âArticles  of Warâ were to me as a sealed volume. I was in despair; to be disgraced  appeared inevitable. At last came the awful summons, and I entered the  apartment, where, at a large table covered with green cloth, sat the  âpotent, grave, and reverend signiors,â who were to decide my fate. One  of them, a very benevolent-looking old gentleman, with a powdered head,  desired me to advance, and having asked me a few questions touching my  name, age, &c., he paused, and, to my inexpressible alarm, took up a  volume from the table, which was no other than that accursed piece of  military codification of which I have made mention. Now, thought I, it  comes, and all is over. After turning over the leaves for some seconds,  he said, raising his head, âI suppose you are well acquainted with the  contents of this volume?â Heaven forgive me! but the instinct of  self-preservation was strong upon me, and I mumbled forth a very  suspicious âYes.â Ye generous casuists, who invent excuses for human  frailty, plead for my justification. âWell,â continued he, closing the  book, âconduct yourself circumspectly in the situation in which you are  about to enter, and you will acquire the approbation of your superiors;  you may now retire.â Those who can imagine the feelings of a culprit  reprieved, after the fatal knot has been comfortably adjusted by a  certain legal functionary; or those of a curate, with Â£50 per annum, and  fifteen small children, on the announcement of a legacy of Â£10,000; or  those of a respectable spinster of forty, on having the question  unexpectedly popped; or, in short, any other situation where felicity  obtrudes unlooked for, may form some idea of mine; I absolutely walked  on air, relieved from this incubus, and gave myself up to the most  delightful buoyancy of spirits. A few days more, and Mr. Cadet Francis  Gernon found himself on board the _Rottenbeam Castle_, steering down  Channel, and with tearful eyes casting a lingering gaze on the shores of  old England.                                        CHAPTER II.      The first scene of this eventful drama closed with my embarkation on  board the _Rottenbeam Castle_, bound for Bengal. Saving an Irish packet,  this was the first ship on which I had ever set foot, and it presented a  new world to my observationâa variety of sights and sounds which, by  giving fresh occupation to my thoughts and feelings, served in some  measure to banish the tristful remembrance of home. All, at first, was a  chaos to me; but when the confusion incidental to embarkation and  departure (the preliminary shake of this living kaleidoscope), a general  clearing out of visitors, custom-house officers, bum-boat women, _et hoc  genus omne_, had subsided, things speedily fell into that regular order  characteristic of vessels of this descriptionâeach individual took up  his proper position, and entered in an orderly manner on his prescribed  and regular routine of duty; and I began to distinguish officers from  passengers, and to learn the rank and importance of each respectively.    Before proceeding further with ship-board scenes, a slight sketch of a  few of the _dramatis personÃ¦_ may not be unacceptable. And first, our  commander, the autocrat of this little empire. Captain McGuffin was a  raw-boned Caledonian, of some six foot three; a huge, red-headed man of  great physical powers, of which, however, his whole demeanour,  singularly mild, evinced a pleasing unconsciousness; bating the latter  quality, he was just such a man of nerves and sinews as in the olden  time, at Falkirk or Bannockburn, one could fancy standing like a tower  of strength, amidst the din and clash of arms, âslaughingâ off heads and  arms, muckle broad-sword in hand, with fearful energy and effect. He had  a sombre and fanatical expression of visage; and I never looked at his  ârueful countenanceâ but I thought I saw the genuine descendant of one  of those stern covenanters of yore, of whom I had readâone of those  âcrop-eared whigsâ who, on lonely moor and mountain, had struggled for  the rights of conscience, and fought with indomitable obstinacy the  glorious fight of freedom.    I soon discovered I was not âalone in my glory,â and that another cadet  was destined to share with me the honours of the âGriffinage.â He was a  gawky, wide-mouthed fellow, with locks like a pound of candles, and  trousers half-way up his calves; one who, from his appearance, it was  fair to infer had never before been ten miles from his native village.  It was a standing source of wonder to all on board (and to my knowledge  the enigma was never satisfactorily solved), by what strange concurrence  of circumstances, what odd twist of Dame Fortuneâs wheel, this Gaspar  Hauserish specimen of rusticity had attained to the distinguished honour  of being allowed to sign himself âgentleman cadet,â in any âwarrant,  bill, or quittance;â but so it was. The old adage, however, applied in  his case; he turned out eventually to be much less of a fool than he  looked.    Our first officer, Mr. Gillans, was a thorough seaman, and a no less  thorough John Bull; he had the then common detestation of the French and  their imputed vices of insincerity, &c., and in endeavouring to avoid  the Scylla of Gallic deceit, went plump into the Charybdis of English  rudeness. He was in truth, a blunt, gruff fellow, who evidently thought  that civility and poltroonery were convertible terms. The captain was  the only person whom his respect for discipline ever allowed him to  address without a growl; in short, the vulgar but expressive phrase, as  âsulky as a bear with a sore head,â seemed made for him expressly, for  in no case could it have been more justly applied. The second mate,  Grinnerson, was a gentlemanly fellow on the whole, but a most eternal  wag and joker. Cadets had plainly, for many a voyage, furnished him with  subjects for the exercise of his facetious vein, and âTom,â _i.e._ Mr.  Thomas Grundy, and myself, received diurnal roastings at his hands. If I  expressed an opinion, âPardon me, my dear sir,â he would say, with mock  gravity, âbut it strikes me that, being _only a cadet_, you can know  nothing about it;â or, âin about ten years hence, when you get your  commission, your opinion âon things in generalâ may be valuable.â If I  flew out, or the peaceable Grundy evinced a disposition to âhog his  back,â he would advise us to keep our temper, to be cool, assuring us,  with dry composure, that the âcadets on the last voyage were never  permitted to get into a passion.â In a word, he so disturbed my  self-complacency, that I long gravely debated the question with myself,  whether I ought not to summon him to the lists when I got to India,  there to answer for his misdeeds. As the voyage drew towards a close,  however, he let off the steam of his raillery considerably, and treated  us with more deference and respect; thereby showing that he had studied  human nature, and knew how to restore the equilibrium of a young manâs  temper, by adding to the weight in the scale of self-esteem. Our doctor  and purser are the only two more connected with the ship whom I shall  notice. The first, Cackleton by name, was a delicate, consumptive,  superfine person, who often reminded me of the injunction, âphysician,  heal thyself.â He ladled out the soup with infinite grace, and was quite  the ladiesâ man. His manners, indeed, would have been gentlemanly and  unexceptionable had they not been for ever pervaded by an obviously  smirking consciousness on his part that they were so. As for Cheesepare,  the purser, all I shall record of him is, that by a happy fortune he had  dropped into the exact place for which nature and his stars appeared to  have designed him. He looked like a purserâspoke like a purserâate and  drank like a purserâand locked himself up for three or four hours _per  diem_ with his hooks and ledgers like a very praiseworthy purser.  Moreover, he carved for a table of thirty or forty, with exemplary  patience, and possessed the happy knack of disposing of the largest  quantity of meat in the smallest given quantity of time of any man I  ever met with, in order to be ready for a renewed round at the mutton.    Of passengers we had the usual number and variety: civilians, returning  with wholesale stocks of English and continental experiences and  recollections of the aristocratic association, &c., for Mofussil  consumption; old officers, going back to ensure their âoff-reckoningsâ  preparatory to their final âoff-reckoning;â junior partners in  mercantile houses; sixteenth cousins from Forres and Invernesshire  obeying the spell of kindred attraction (would that we had a little more  of its influence south of the Tweed!); officers to supply the wear and  tear of cholera and dysentery in his (then) Majestyâs regiments; matrons  returning to expectant husbands, and bright-eyed spinsters to getâa peep  at the countryânothing more;âthen we had an assistant surgeon or two,  more _au fait_ at whist than Galenicals, and the two raw, unfledged  griffinsâto wit, Grundy and myselfâcompleted the list. But of the  afore-mentioned variety, I shall only select half a dozen for particular  description, and as characteristic of the mass.    First, there was Colonel Kilbaugh, a colonel of cavalry and ex-resident  of Paugulabad, who, in spite of his high-heeled Hobys, was a diminutive  figure, pompous, as little men generally are, and so anxious,  apparently, to convince the world that he had a soul above his inches,  that egad, sir, it was dangerous for a man above the common standard of  humanity to look at him, or differ in opinion in the slightest degree.  His was in truth                   A fiery soul, which, working out its way,                 Fretted the pigmy body to decay.    He excelled (in his own estimation) in long stories, which he told with  an extraordinary minuteness of detail. They generally began with,  âShortly after I was appointed to the residency of Paugulabad,â or, âThe  year before, or two years after, I left the residency of Paugulabad:â in  short, that was his chronological starting-point. The colonelâs _yarns_  principally (though not entirely) related to wonderful sporting  exploits, and the greater the bounce the more scrupulously exact was he  in the _minutiÃ¦_, magnanimously disregarding the terrors of  cross-examination, should a seven-foot mortal venture one. âIt was the  largest tiger that, sir, I ever killed; he stood 4 feet 4Â¾ inches to the  top of his shoulderâ4 feet 4Â¾ was it, by-the-bye?âno, Iâm wrong; 4 feet  4Â½. I killed him with a double Joe I got from our doctor; I think it was  the cold season before I left the residency of Paugulabad.â It was one  of the most amusing things in the world to see him marching up and down  the poop with our Colossus of a skipperââOssa to a wartââone little fin  of a hand behind his back, and laying down the law with the other;  skipper, with an eye to future recommendation, very deferential of  course.    Next, in point of rank, was Mr. Goldmore, an ex-judge of the Sudder  Dewanny Adawlut; a man of birth and education, and an excellent sample  of the distinguished service to which he belonged. His manners were kind  and urbane, though he was a little peppery sometimes, particularly when  I beat him at chess. He had come home a martyr to liver; and the yellow  cheek, the lacklustre eye, and the feeble step, all told too plainly  that he was returning to die. His wife, fifteen years younger than  himself, exhibited beside him a striking contrast; she, âbuxom, blithe,  and _debonnair_ââa vigorous plant in florid pride; he, poor fellow, in  the âsear and yellowâ leaf. She was a warm-hearted, excellent creature,  native goodness beaming in her eye, but had one fault, and that a  prominent one. Having in India, as is often the case with the sex, been  thrown much at out-stations amongst male society, she had insensibly  adopted a âmannishâ tone, used terms of Indian conventional slangâbad in  a man, but odious from female lipsâlaughed heartily at stories seasoned  with equivoque, and sometimes told such herself with off-hand _naÃ¯vetÃ©_  at the cuddy-table, producing a wink from Mr. Grinnerson to Ensign  OâShaughnessy, and an uncommon devotion to his plate on the part of Mr.  Goldmore himself.    Major Rantom, of the Dragoonsâsoldierly, gentleman-like, and  five-and-thirtyâcommanded the detachment of troops, to which were  attached Ensigns Gorman and OâShaughnessy, two fine âanimals,â that had  recently been caught in the mountains of Kerry; and an ancient  centurion, Capt. Marpeet, of the Native Infantry, must conclude these  samples of the masculine gender. Marpeet was a character, upon the  wholeâa great man for short whist and Hodgsonâs pale ale. The Sporting  Magazine, Taplinâs Farriery, and Dundasâs Nineteen ManÅuvres, seemed to  have constituted the extent of his reading, though some conversation he  one day had about âzubber, zeer, and pesh,â and that profound work the  Tota Kuhannee, seemed to indicate that he had at least entered on the  flowery paths of Oriental literature. Dundas, however, was his strong  pointâhis tower of strengthâhis one idea. Ye powers! how amazingly  convincing and fluent he was when he took that subject in hand! Many a  tough discussion would he have with the pompous little colonel, whether  the right or left stood fast, &c., and who, having been a Resident, and  knowing, therefore, everything, of course knew something of that also.    But _places aux demoiselles_! make way for the spinsters! Let me  introduce to the readerâs acquaintance Miss Kitty and Miss Olivia  Jenkins, Miss Maria Balgrave, and Miss Anna Maria Sophia Dobbikins. The  first two were going to their father, a general officer in the Madras  Presidency; the eldest, Kitty, was a prude, haunted by the âdemon of  propriety,â the youngest, dear Olivia, a perfect giggleâwith such a pair  of eyes!âbut âthereby hangs a tale.â Miss Maria Balgrave was consigned  to a house of business in Calcutta, to be forwarded, by the first safe  conveyance, up the country to her dear friend Mrs. Kurrybhat, the lady  of Ensign Kurrybhat, who had invited her out; she was very plain, but of  course possessed its usual concomitant, great amiability of temper. Miss  Dobbikins was a Bath and Clifton belle, hackneyed and _passÃ©_, but  exhibiting the remains of a splendid face and figure; it was passing  strange that so fine a creature should have attained a certain age  without having entered that state which she was so well calculated to  adorn, whilst doubtless many a snub-nosed thing had gone off under her  own nose. I have seen many such cases; and it is a curious problem for  philosophical investigation, why those whom âevery oneâ admires ânobodyâ  marries.    Having given these sketches of a few of my companions, let me now  proceed with my voyage. Leaving Deal we had to contend with contrary  winds, and when off Portsmouth, they became so adverse, that the captain  determined on dropping anchor, and there wait a favourable change. In  three days the wind became light, veered to the proper quarter, and our  final departure was fixed for the following morning. My last evening off  Portsmouth long remained impressed on my memory. Full often, in my  subsequent wanderings in the silent forest or the lonely desert, in the  hushed camp, or on the moon-lit rampart, where nought save the  sentinelâs voice broke through the silence of the night, have I pictured  this last aspect of my native land. I had been engaged below, inditing  letters for home and other occupations, the whole day, when, tired of  the confinement, I mounted on the poop: the parting glow of a summerâs  evening rested on the sceneâa tranquillity and repose little, alas! in  consonance with the state of my feelings, once more painfully excited at  the prospect of the severance from all that was dear to me. Hitherto  excitement had sustained me, but now I felt it in its full force.                      Land of my sires, what mortal hand                    Can eâer untie the filial band                    That knits me to thy rugged strand?    I leant my head upon my hand, and gave myself up to sad and melancholy  reflections. On one side stretched the beautiful coast of the Isle of  Wight, whilst the fast-gathering shades of evening were slowly blending  into one dark mass the groves and villas of Cowes; lights from many a  pleasant window streamed across the rippling seaâlights, methought,  cheering circles of happy faces, like those I lately gazed upon, but  which I might never see more. Many a tall and gallant man-of-war rode  ahead of us, fading in the gathering mist; boats, leaving their long,  silvery tracks behind them, glided across the harbour; whilst the lights  of the town, in rapid succession, broke forth as those of the day  declined. The very tranquillity of such a scene as this, to a person in  my then state of mind, by mocking, as it were, the inward grief, made it  to be more deeply felt. I looked at my native shores, as a lover gazes  on his mistress for the last time, till the boom of the evening gun, and  the increasing darkness, warned me that it was time to go below.               Calm were the elements, nightâs silence deep,             The waves scarce murmuring, and the winds asleep.    In a few days we were in the Bay of Biscayâand now my troubles began.                                        CHAPTER III.      The Bay of Biscay well merits its turbulent character; of this we soon  had ample demonstration, for the _Rottenbeam Castle_ had scarcely  entered within its stormy bounds, when the wind, hitherto moderate,  became rough and boisterous, and in a little time freshened almost to a  gale; the vessel began to pitch and rollâthe shrouds crackedâthe few  sails set were strained almost to splittingâand mountain seas with wild,  foamy crests ever and anon burst over us, clearing the waist and  forecastle, and making the âgood shipâ quiver through every plank and  timber. These _sublimities_ were quite new to me, and produced their  usual effects on the unseasonedâan involuntary tribute to Old Oceanânot  a metrical outpouring, but one of a less spiritual quality, on which it  would be superfluous to dilate.    Our first dayâs dinner on board, with things in the state I have  describedâ_i.e._ the _Rottenbeam Castle_ reeling and staggering like a  drunken manâwas a most comical affair, and I should have enjoyed it  extremely had my nausea been less. It is true, with some variations, the  scene was afterwards frequently repeated (except when sea-pie was the  order of the day); but then, though I was no longer qualmish, it in turn  had lost the master-charm of novelty. We were summoned to dinner as  usual, on the day in question, by the drummers and fifersâor rather, to  be more respectful, the âCaptains Band;â but, from the difficulty of  preserving an equilibrium, these worthies mangled the âRoast Beef of Old  Englandâ most unmercifully. The dapper little steward, with his train of  subordinates, had some difficulty in traversing the deck with their  savoury burthens; unable to march as before, heads erect, like a squad  of recruits, the grand purveyor, with his silver tureen in the van, they  now emerged theatrically from the culinary regionsâadvancing with slides  and side-steps, like a _corps de ballet_ânow a halt, then a simultaneous  runâthen balancing on one legâand finally (hitting the moment of an  equipoise) a dart into the cuddy, where, with some little difficulty,  each contrived to deposit his dish. The passengers, emerging from  various doors and openings, tottering and holding on as best they might,  now made their way to seats, and amidst the most abominable creaking and  groaning that ever saluted my ears the operation of dinner began. In  spite of sand-bags, however, and all other appliances, there was no  restraining the ambulatory freaks of the dishes, and we were scarcely  seated when a tremendous lee-lurch sent a tureen of peasoup souse over  the doctor s kerseymere waistcoat and Brummel tie; and a roast pig, as  if suddenly resuscitated and endued with a spirit of frenzy, darted from  its dish, and, cantering furiously down the whole length of the table,  finally effected a lodgment in Miss Dobbikinsâ lap, to the infinite  dismay of that young lady, who uttering a faint shriek, hastily essayed,  with Ensign OâShaughnessyâs assistance, to divest herself of the  intrusive porker. I, for my part, was nearly overwhelmed by an  involuntary embrace from the charming Miss Olivia; whilst, to add to the  confusion, at this particular moment, Mr. Cadet Grundy, governed rather  by sight than a due consideration of circumstances and the laws of  gravitation, made a desperate lunge at one of the swinging tables, which  he thought was making a most dangerous approach to the perpendicular, in  order to steady it, and the immediate result was, a fearful crash of  glasses and decanters, and a plentiful libation of port and sherry.    âAre ye mod, sir, to do that?â exclaimed the captain, with  ill-suppressed vexation at the destruction of his glasses, and  forgetting his usual urbanity.    âI thought they were slipping off, sir,â said Grundy, with great  humility.    âYe haâ slupped them off in gude airnest yeersel, sir,â rejoined Captain  McGuffin, unable, however, to repress a smile, in which all joined, at  the idea of Grundyâs extreme simplicity. âDinna ye ken, sir, that itâs  the ship, and not the swing-table, that loses its pairpendicular? Here,  steward,â continued he, âclare away these frogments, and put mair  glasses on the table.â    The colloquy ended, there was a further lull, when, heave yo ho! away  went the ship on the other side; purser jammed up against the  bulk-headârollsâlegs and wingsâboiled beef, carrots, and potatoes, all  racing, as if to see which would first reach the other side of the  table. At this instant snap went a chair-lashing, and the ex-resident of  Paugulabad was whirled out of the cuddy door, like a thunder-bolt.    âThere she goes again!â exclaimed the second mate; âhold on, gentlemen.â  The caution was well-timed, for down she went on the opposite tack; once  more, the recoil brought the colonel back again, with the force of a  battering-ram, attended by an awful smash of the butlers plate-basket,  and other deafening symptoms of reaction. Oh, âtis brave sport, a  cuddy-dinner in an Indiaman, and your ship rolling gunwales under.    âBy the powers, now, but this hates everything entirely,â exclaimed  Ensign Gorman, who, like myself, was a griff, and had never witnessed  anything of the sort before.    âOh, its nothing at all thisâmere childâs play, to what youâll have  round the Cape,â observed the second mate, grinning with malice  prepense.    âThe deuce take you, now, Grinnerson, for a _Joveâs_ comforter,â  rejoined the ensign, laughing; âsure if itâs worse than this, it is  weâll be sailing bottom upwards, and ateing our males with our heels in  the air.â    âOh, I assure you, itâs a mere trifle this to the rolling and pitching I  myself have experienced,â said the little colonel, who having recovered  his seat and composure, now put in his oar, unwilling to be silent when  anything wonderful was on the _tapis_. âI remember,â continued the  ex-resident, picking his teeth _nonchalamment_ (he generally picked his  teeth when delivered of a bouncer), âthat wasâlet me see, about the year  1810âshortly after I resigned the residency of Paugulabadâwe were off  Cape Lagullas, when our vessel rolled incessantly for a fortnight in the  heaviest sea I ever remember to have seen; we were half our time under  waterâa shark actually swam through the cuddyâeverything went by the  boardâlive stock all washed awayâcouldnât cook the whole time, but lived  on biscuit, Bologna sausages, Bombay ducks, and so forth. To give you an  idea of itâladies will excuse meâI actually wore out the seats of two  pair of inexpressibles from the constant friction to which they were  subjectedâa sort of perpetual motionâno preserving the same centre of  gravity for a single moment.â    This sally of the colonelâs had an equally disturbing effect on the  gravity of the cuddy party, and all laughed heartily at it.    âYou were badly enough off, certainly, colonel,â said our wag, the  second officer (with a sly wink at one of his confederates); âbut I  think I can mention a circumstance of the kind still more extraordinary.  When I was last in the China seas, in the _John Tomkins_, she rolled so  prodigiously after a tuffoon, that she actually wore off all the copper  sheathing, and very nearly set the sea on fire by this same friction you  speak of. Itâs strange, but as true as what you have just mentioned,  colonel.â    âSir,â said the colonel, bristling up, for he did not at all relish the  drift of this story, âyou are disposed to be pleasant, sir; facetious,  sir; but let me beg in future that you will reserve your jokes for some  one else, and not exhibit your humour at my expense, or it may be  unpleasant to both of us.â    All looked graveâthe affair was becoming seriousâthe colonel was a known  fire-eater, and Grinnerson, who saw he had overshot the mark, seemed a  little disconcerted, but struggled to preserve his composureâit was a  juncture well calculated to test all the powers of impudence and tact of  that very forward gentleman; but, somehow or other, he did back cleverly  out of the scrape, without any additional offence to the colonelâs  dignity, or a farther compromise of his own, and before the cloth was  removed, a magnanimous challenge to Mr. Grinnerson, âto take wine,â came  from the colonel (who at bottom was a very worthy little man, though  addicted, unfortunately, to the Ferdinand Mendez Pinto vein), and  convinced us that happily no other sort of challenge was to be  apprehended. And so ended my first dayâs dinner in a high sea in the Bay  of Biscay.                Now had the moon, resplendent lamp of night,              Oâer heavenâs pure azure shed her sacred light.    In plain prose, it was past seven bells, and I (like Mahometâs coffin)  was swinging in the steerage, forgetful of all my cares; whether in my  dreams I was wandering once more, as in childhoodâs days, by the flowery  margin of the silver Avon, listening to the blackbirdâs mellow note from  the hawthorn dellâlightly footing the Spanish dance in Mangeonâs  ball-room at Cliftonâor comfortably sipping a cup of bohea in the family  circle at homeâI do not now well remember: but whatever was the nature  of those sweet illusions, they were suddenly dispelled, in the dead of  the night, by one of the most fearful agglomerations of stunning sounds  that ever broke the slumbers of a cadet: groaning timbersâhoarse  shoutsâsmashing crockeryâfalling knife-boxesâand the loud gurgling  bubble of invading watersâall at once, and with terrible discord, burst  upon my astonished ear. Thinking the ship was scuttling, or, that some  other (to me unknown) marine disaster was befalling her, I sprung up in  a state between sleeping and waking, overbalanced my cot, and was  pitched out head-foremost on the deck. Here a body of water, ancle-deep,  and washing to and fro, lent a startling confirmation to my  apprehensions that the ship was actually _in articulo immersionis_. I  struggled to gain my feet, knocked my naked shins against a box of  saddlery of the majorâs, slipped and slid about on the wet and slimy  deck, and finally, my feet flying from under me, came bump down on the  broadest side of my person, with stunning emphasis and effect. Another  effort to gain the erect position was successful, and, determined to  visit the âglimpses of the moonâ once more before I became food for  fishes, I hurriedly and instinctively scrambled my way towards the  companion ladder. Scarcely was I in its vicinity, and holding on by a  staunchion, when the vessel gave another profound roll, so deep that the  said ladder, being ill-secured, fell over backwards, saluting the deck  with a tremendous bang, followed by a second crash, and bubbling of  waters effecting a forcible entry. Paralyzed and confounded by this  succession of sounds and disasters, I turned, still groping in the  darkness, to seek some information touching this uproar, from some one  of the neighbouring sleepers. I soon lighted on a hammock, and tracing  the mummy-case affair from the feet upwards my hands rested on a cold  nose, then a rough curly pate surmounting it, whose owner, snoring with  a ten-pig power, would, I verily believe, have slept on had the crash of  doom been around him. âHollo! here,â said I, giving him a shake. A grunt  and a mumbled execration were all it elicited. I repeated the  experiment, and having produced some symptoms of consciousness, begged  earnestly to know if all I had described was an ordinary occurrence, or  if we were really going to the bottom. I had now fairly roused the  sleeping lion; up he started in a terrible passion; asked me what the  deuce made me bother him with my nonsense at that time of night, and  then, consigning me to a place whence no visitor is permitted to return,  once more addressed himself to his slumbers. This refreshing sample of  nautical philosophy, though rather startling, convinced me that I had  mistaken the extent of the danger; in fact, there was none at all; so  feeling my way back to my cot, I once more, though with becoming  caution, got into it, determined, sink or swim, to have my sleep out. On  rising, disorder and misery, in various shapes, a wet deck and boxes  displaced, met my view; I found my coat and pantaloons pleasantly  saturated with sea-water, which it appeared had entered by an open port  or scuttle, and that my boots had sailed away to some unknown region on  a voyage of discovery. âOh! why did I âlist?ââ I exclaimed, in the  bitterness of my discomfort; âwhy did I ever âlist?ââ Ye cadets, attend  to the moral which this narrative conveys, and learn, by my unhappy  example, always to secure your toggery, high and dry, before you turn  in, and to study well the infirmities of that curious pendulum balance,  the cot, lest, like me, ye be suddenly decanted therefrom on the  any-thing-but-downy surface of an oaken deck!    With what feelings of delight does the youth first enter upon the  fairy region of the tropics, a region which Cook and Anson, and the  immortal fictions of St. Pierre and De Foe, have invested in his  estimation with a sweet and imperishable charm! The very air to him  is redolent of a spicy aroma, of a balmy and tranquillizing  influence, whilst delicious but indefinable visions of the scenes he  is about to visitâof palmy groves, and painted birds, and coral  isles âin the deep sea set,â float before him in all those roseate  hues with which the young and excited fancy loves to paint them.  Paul and VirginaâRobinsonâFridayâgoatsâsavages and monkeysâye are  all for ever bound to my heart by the golden links of early  association and acquaintanceship. Happy Juan Fernandez, too!  Atalantis of the waveâUtopia of the roving imaginationâhow oft have  I longed to abide in ye, and envied Robinson his fateâhonest man of  goatskins and unrivalled resources! But one ingredient, a wife, was  wanting to complete your felicity; had you but rescued one of the  Miss Fridays from the culinary fate designed for her brother, and  made her your companion, you would have been the most comfortable  fellow on record.    Griffin as I was I partook strongly of these common but delightful  feelings I have attempted to describe, and in the change of climate and  objects which every weekâs sail brought forth, found much to interest  and excite meâthe shoal of flying-fish, shooting like a silver shower  from the ocean, and skimming lightly over the crested waves; the gambols  of the porpoise; the capture of a shark; fishing for bonetta off the  bowsprit; a waterspout; speculations on a distant sail; her approach;  the friendly greeting; the first and last!âwere all objects and events  pleasing in themselves, but doubly so when viewed in relation to the  general monotony of a life at sea. Nothing, I think, delighted me more  than contemplating the gorgeous sunsets, as we approached the equator.  Here, in England, that luminary is a sickly affair, but particularly so  when viewed through our commonly murky atmosphere, and there may be some  truth in the Italianâs splenetic remark in favour of the superior warmth  of the moon of his own country. But in the fervid regions of the tropics  it is that we see the glorious emblem of creative power in all his pride  and majesty, whether rising in his strength, ârobed in flames and amber  light,â ruling in meridian splendour, or sinking slowly to rest on his  ocean couch of gold and crimson, in softened but ineffable refulgence;  it is (but particularly in its parting aspect) an object eminently  calculated to awaken the most elevated thoughts of the Creatorâs power,  mingled with a boundless admiration for the beauty of His works. Yes,  neither language, painting, nor poetry, can adequately portray that most  glorious of spectaclesâa tropical sunset.    Ensign OâShaughnessy having sworn âby all the bogs in Kerry,â that he  would put a brace of pistol-balls through Neptune, or Juno, or any âsa  Godâ of them all, that should dare to lay hands upon him; and a  determination to resist the initiatory process of ducking in  bilge-water, and shaving with a rusty hoop, having manifested itself in  other quarters, Captain McGuffin, glad of a pretext, and really  apprehensive of mischief, had it intimated to the son of Saturn and his  spouse, that their visit in crossing the line would be dispensed with.  In so doing, it appears to me that he exercised a wise discretion;  Neptuneâs tomfooleries, at least when carried to their usual extent,  being one of those ridiculous customs âmore honoured in the breach than  in the observance;â one which may well be allowed to sleep with âMaid  Marian,â âthe Lord of Misruleâ and other samples of the âwisdom of our  ancestors,â who were emphatically but âchildren of a larger growth,â to  whom horse play and âtinselâ were most attractive. On crossing the  equator, however, the old but more harmless joke of exhibiting the  _line_ through a telescope was played off on one greenhorn, sufficiently  soft to admit of its taking effect.    âDo you make it out, Jones?â said Grinnerson, who had got up the scene,  to one of the middys, a youngster intently engaged in reconnoitering  through a glass half as long as himself.    âI think I do, sir,â said Jones, with a difficultly-suppressed grin.    âWhat is he looking for?â asked the simple victim.    âThe Line, to be sure; didnât I tell you we were to cross it to-day?â    âOh yes, I remember; I should like amazingly to see it, if you would  oblige me with the telescope.â    âOh, certainly; Jones, give Mr. Brown the glass.â    The soft man took it, looked, but declared that he saw nought but sky  and sea.    âHere, try mine,â continued the second mate; ââtis a better one than  that you have,â handing him one with a hair or wire across the large end  of it. âNow do you see it?â    âI think I do; oh, yes, most distinctly. And that really is the line?  Bless me, how small it is!â    This was the climax; the middys held their mouths, and sputtering,  tumbled in a body down the ladder to have their laugh out, whilst a  general side-shaking at the griffâs expense took place amongst the  remaining group on the poop.    Well, the stormy dangers of the Cape safely passed, the pleasant isles  of Johanna, sweet as those which Waller sung, duly visitedâDondra  HeadâAdamâs Peakâthe woody shores of Ceylon here skirted and admired,  those beautiful shores, where               Partout on voit mÃ»rir, partout on voit Ã©clore,             Et les fruits de Pomone et les prÃ©sents de Flore;    and the âspicy galesâ from cinnamon groves duly snuffed up and  appreciated (_entre nous_, a burnt pastile of Mr. Grinnersonâs, and not  Ceylon, furnished the âspicy galesâ on this occasion), we found  ourselves at last off the far-famed coast of Coromandel, and fast  approaching our destination.    It is pleasant at certain seasons to glide over the summer seas of these  delightful latitudes, whilst the vessel spreads abroad all her snowy  canvas to arrest every light and vagrant zephyr, to hang over the side,  and whilst the ear is soothed by the lapping ripple of small, crisp  waves, idly breaking on the vesselâs bows as she moves scarce  perceptibly through them, to gaze on the sky and ocean, and indulge in  that half-dreamy listlessness when gentle thoughts unbidden come and go.  How beautiful is the dark blue main, relieved by the milk-white flash of  the seabirdâs wing! how picturesque the Indian craft, with their striped  latteen sails, as they creep along those palm-covered coasts, studded  with temples and pagodas! and seaward resting on the far-off horizon,  how lovely the fleecy piles of rose-tinted clouds, seeming to the fancy  the ethereal abodes of pure and happy spirits! There is in the thoughts  to which such scenes give birth a rationality as improving to the heart  as it is remote from a forced and mawkish sentimentality. Such were my  sensations as we crept along the Indian coast, till in a few days the  _Rottenbeam Castle_ came to anchor in the roads of Madras, amidst a  number of men-of-war, Indiamen, Arab grabs, and country coasters.    The first thing we saw, on dropping anchor, was a man-of-warâs boat  pulling for us, which created a considerable sensation amongst the crew,  to whom the prospect of impressment was anything but agreeable. The  boat, manned by a stout crew of slashing young fellows, in straw hats,  and with tattooed arms, was soon alongside, and the lieutenant, with the  air of a monarch, mounted the deck. He was a tall, strapping man, with a  hanger banging against his heels, loose trousers, a tarnished _swab_  (epaulette) on his shoulder, and a glazed cocked-hat stuck rakishly fore  and aft on his head: in my idea, the very _beau idÃ©al_ of a âfirst  leftenant.â                                        CHAPTER IV.      In the last chapter I left the _Rottenbeam Castle_ just arrived in the  roads of Madras, and the frigateâs boat alongside. Our commander, with a  grave look, advanced to meet the officer, who, saluting him in an easy  and off-hand manner, announced himself as lieutenant of H.M. ship  _Thunderbolt_, and desired him âto turn up the hands.â Captain McGuffin  was beginning to remonstrate, declaring that some of his best sailors  had been pressed a few days before (which was the fact), and that he had  barely sufficient to carry the ship round to Bengal, &c., when the  lieutenant cut him short, declaring he had nothing to do with that  matter; that his orders were peremptory, and must be obeyed.    âI shall appeal to the admiral,â said our skipper, rather ruffled.    âYou may appeal to whom you choose, sir,â replied the lieutenant,  somewhat haughtily, and giving his hanger a kick, to cause it to resume  its hindward position; âbut now, and in the meantime, if you please,  youâll order up your men.â    These were âhard nutsâ for McGuffin âto crack;â on his own deck too,  where he had reigned absolute but a few minutes beforeâ                     The monarch of all he surveyâd,                   Whose right there was none to dispute.    But he felt that the iron heel of a stronger despotism than his own was  upon him, and that he had no resource but submission. He consequently  gave the necessary orders, and straightway the shrill whistle of the  boatswain was soon heard, summoning the sailors to the muster.    âOnward they moved, a melancholy band,â slouching and hitching up their  trousers, and were soon ranged in rank and file along the deck. The  lieutenant stalked up the line (he certainly was a noble-looking fellow,  just the man for a cutting-out party, or to head a column of boarders),  and turned several of them about, something after the manner in which a  butcher in Smithfield selects his fat sheep, and then putting aside  those he thought worthy of âhonour and hard knocksâ in his Majestyâs  service, he ordered them forthwith to bring up their hammocks and kits,  and prepare for departure. Amongst those thus unceremoniously chosen to  increase the crew of the _Thunderbolt_, were two or three ruddy, lusty  lads, who had come out as swabs, or loblolly boys, and were making their  first voyage, to see how the life of a sailor agreed with them, little  thinking, a few days before, of the change that awaited them. I think I  see them now, blubbering as they descended the side, with their hammocks  and small stocks of worldly goods on their shoulders, waving adieu to  their comrades, and thinking, doubtless, of âhome, sweet home,â and what  âmother would say when she heard of it.â On one old man-of-warâs man of  the _Rottenbeam Castle_, whom I had often noticed, the lieutenant, keen  as a hawk, pounced _instanter_; his experienced eye detecting at once in  the long pigtail, corkscrew ringlets, and devil-may-care air of honest  Jack, the true outward characteristics of that noble but eccentric  biped, a downright British tar, and prime seamen. âYouâll do for us,â  said the lieutenant, taking him by the collar of his jacket, and leading  him out. âThereâs two words to that there bargain, sir,â said Jack (who  had had _quantum suff._ of the regâlar sarvice), with the air of one who  knew that he stood on unassailable ground. So squirting out a little  âbaccy juice, and rummaging his jacket-pocket, he produced therefrom a  tin tobacco-box, of more than ordinary dimensions, from which, after  considerable fumbling (for Jack was evidently unused to handling  literary documents of any kind), he extracted a soiled and tattered  âprotection,â which, deliberately unfolding (a ticklish operation, by  the way, the many component parallelograms being connected by the  slenderest filaments), he handed it over to the lieutenant. Having so  done, he hitched up his waistband, with his dexter fin, tipped his  comrades something between a nod and a wink, as much as to say, âI think  thatâll bring him up with a round turn,â and stroking down his hair,  awaited the result. The officer cast his eye over the thing of shreds  and patches. It contained a âtrue bill,â so he returned it; and Jack,  having carefully packed and re-stowed his â_noli me tangere_,â gave  another squirt, and rolled off in triumph to the forecastle. The only  fellow glad to go âto sarve him MajestyââI blush whilst I record itâwas  Massa Sambo, a good-humoured nigger, and a fine specimen of the mere  animal man, who, having received more of what is vulgarly termed  âmonkeyâs allowanceâ on board the _Rottenbeam Castle_ than suited him,  left us in a high glee, grinning, capering, slapping his hands and  singing âRule Britanniaâ in regular âPossum up a gum-treeâ style, to the  great amusement of us all.    Madras, from the roads, wore to me a very picturesque and interesting  appearance; the long ranges of white verandahed buildings, the noble  fort, with Englandâs meteor standard floating from the flag-staff, the  beach, the blue sky, the cocoa-nut trees, the white wreaths of breaking  surf, the shipping, the Massoolah boats, the native craft, all  constituted a novel and striking _coup dâÅil_, which fully realized what  in imagination I had pictured it. Looking over the side, shortly after  we had anchored, I perceived to my astonishment, a naked figure walking  apparently on the surface of the sea, and rapidly approaching us. This  was a catamaran man, the bearer of a despatch from the shore. His  diminutive bark, three or four logs, half submerged, and on which he had  ploughed through the surf, was soon alongside, and the brown and  dripping savage (for such he looked) scrambling on board. He sprung upon  the deck, as a favourite opera-dancer bounds upon the stage, confident  of an applauding welcome, and, making a ducking salaam, proceeded, in a  very business-like manner, to disengage from his head a conical  salt-basket sort of hat, from which, secured under a fold of linen, he  produced his letters safe and dry; these with the words, âchit, sahib,â  spoken in tones as delicate as the frame of the speaker, he immediately  delivered to the captain. The arrival of this messenger caused a  considerable sensation, and the griffs of all descriptions gathered  round him, conning the strange figure with open mouths and wondering  eyes. The ladies, too (stimulated by curiosity), rushed to the cuddy  door to have a peep at him, but made a rapid retreat on perceiving the  paradisiacal costume of our hero. I shall never forget Miss Oliviaâs  involuntary scream, or Miss Dobbikinsâ expression of countenance, on  suddenly confronting this little swarthy Apollo:â                      Horror in all his majesty was there,                    Mute and magnificent without a tear.    Our admiration of the catamaran man had hardly subsided when a far more  extraordinary character made his appearance. âAvast there, my hearties!â  sounded the rough voice of a seaman, âand make way for the commodore.â  As he spoke, the crowd of sailors and recruits opened out, and his  Excellency Commodore Cockle, chief of the catamarans, was seen advancing  in great state from the gangway. This potent commander, who, by the way,  had performed his toilet _in transitu_, after passing through the surf,  was attired in an old naval uniform coat, under which appeared his naked  neck and swarthy bosom; a huge cocked-hat, âwhich had seen a little  service,â a pair of kerseymere dress shorts, without stockings, and a  swinging hanger banging at his heels, made up as strange a figure of the  genus scarecrow as I ever remember to have seen out of a cornfield.    âBy the powers, Pat, and what have we here?â said Mick Nolan, one of the  recruits, to his comrade Pat Casey.    âFaith,â says Pat, âand myself canât tell ye, unless âtis one of them  _Ingine_ rajahs, or ould Neptune himself, that should have been after  shaving us off the line.â    âDevil a bit,â rejoined Mick; âIâm thinking itâs something of an  _Aistern_ Guy Fawkes, thatâs going to play off some of his fun amongst  us.â    Thus speculated the jokers, whilst the commodore, fully impressed with a  sense of his importance, swaggered about the deck with all the quiet  pride of a high official, putting questions, and replying to the queries  of old acquaintance. Alas! poor human nature! thou art everywhere  essentially the same. Dear to thee is a little power and authority in  any shape, and thou exhibitest thy âfantastic tricksâ as much in the  bells and feathers of the savage, as under the coif of the judge, or the  ermine of the monarch! The âCommodore,â to whom the English cognomen of  âCockleâ had been given, exercised his high functions under a commission  furnished him by some wag, but of which he was quite as proud as if it  had emanated from royalty itself. It was couched in the proper _lingua  technica_ of such instruments, and commenced in something like the  following manner: âKnow all men by these presents, that our trusty and  well-beloved Cockle is hereby constituted Commodore and Commander of the  Catamaran Squadron, and duly empowered to exercise all the high  functions thereunto appertaining. The aforesaid Cockle is authorized to  render his services to all parties requiring them, on their paying for  the same. All captains and commanders of his Majestyâs and the  Honourable Companyâs ships, and of all other ships and vessels  whatsoever, are hereby required and directed to take fruit, fish, eggs,  &c., from the said Cockle (if they think fit), on their paying him  handsomely in the current coin of the realm, &c.â    The next day the passengers went ashore; officers full fig; ladies,  civilians, and cadets, all in their best attire, crowding the benches of  the Massoolah boat, and balancing, and holding on as best they could. Of  all sea-going craft, from the canoe of the Greenlander to the  line-of-battle-ship, the Massoolah boat is, perhaps, one of the most  extraordinary. Imagine a huge affair, something in shape like one of  those paper cock-boats which children make for amusement, or an  old-fashioned tureen, or the transverse section of a pear or pumpkin,  stem and stern alike, composed of light and flexible planks, sewn  together with coir, and riding buoyant as a gull on the heaving wave,  the sides rising six feet or so above its surface, the huge empty shell  crossed by narrow planks or benches, on which, when seated, or rather  roosted, your legs dangle in air several feet from the bottom: further,  picture in the fore-part a dozen or more spare black creatures, each  working an unwieldy pole-like paddle to a dismal and monotonous  chantâand you may have some idea of a Massoolah boat and its equipage;  the only thing, however, that can live in the tremendous surf that  lashes the coast of Coromandel.    âAre you all right there, in the Massoolah boat?â shouted one of the  shipâs officers.    âAy, ay, sir,â responded a little middy in charge of us.    âCast her off then,â said the voice; and immediately the connecting rope  was thrown on board, and off we swung, gently rising and falling on the  long undulations, which were soon to assume the more formidable  character of bursting surges. As we advance, I honestly confess, though  I put a bold face on it, I felt most confoundedly nervous, being under  serious apprehensions that one of the many sharks I had just seen would  soon have the pleasure of breakfasting on a gentleman cadet,  _cote-lettes Ã  la Griffin_, no doubt, if gastronomy ranks as an art  amongst that voracious fraternity. On approaching the surf, the  boatmenâs monotonous chant quickened to a wild _ulluloo_. We were _in  medias res_. I looked astern, and there, at some distance, but in full  chase, advanced a curling mountain-billow, opening its vast concave  jaws, as if to devour us. On, on it came. â_Ullee! ullee! ullee!_â  shouted the rowers; smash came the wave; up flew the stern, down went  the prow; squall went the ladies, over canted the major, Grundy, and the  ex-resident, while those more fortunate in retaining their seats held on  with all the energy of alarm with one hand and dashed the brine from  their habiliments with the other. The wave passed, and order a little  restored, the boatmen pulled again with redoubled energy, to make as  much way as they could before the next should overtake us. It soon came,  roaring like so many fiends, and with nearly similar results. Another  and another followed, till, at last, the unwieldy bark, amidst an awful  bobbery, swung high and dry on the shelving beach; and out we all  sprung, right glad once more to feel ourselves on _terra firma_,  respecting which, be it observed, _en passant_, I hold the opinion of  the Persian, that a yard of it is worth a thousand miles of salt-water.    Here then was I at last, in very truth, treading the soil of Indiaâof  that wondrous, teaming, and antique land, the fertile subject of my  earliest thoughts and imaginationsâthat land whose âbarbaric pearl and  goldâ has stimulated the cupidity of nations down the long stream of  time, from SabÃ¦an, PhÅnician, Tyrian, and Venetian, to Mynheer Van  Stockenbreech, and honest John Bull himselfâwhose visionary luxuries  have warmed full many a Western poetâs imagination, and whose strange  vicissitudes have furnished such ample matter to adorn the moralistâs  and historianâs pages.    As I gazed on the turbaned crowds, the flaunting robes, the huge  umbrellas, the passing palankeens, the black sentinels, the strange  birds, and even (pardon the climax) the little striped squirrels, which  gambolled up and down the pillars of the custom-houseâsights so new and  strange to me,âI almost began to doubt my own identity, and to think I  had fallen into some new planet. Assuredly, of all the sunny moments  which chequer the path of lifeâs pilgrimage here below, there are few  whose brightness can compare with those of our first entrance on a new  and untrodden land. What music is there in every sound! What an  exhilarating freshness in every object! The peachâs bloom, the  butterflyâs down, or the painted bubble, however, are but types of them.  Alas! as of all sublunary enjoyments, they vanish upon contact, or at  best, bear not long the grasp of possession.    My feelings were still in a state of tumultuous excitement, when, gazing  about, I observed a native, in flowing robes and large gold ear rings,  bearing down upon me. With a profound salaam, and the smirking smile of  an old acquaintance, he proceeded to address me:    âHow dâye do, Sare?â said he.    âPretty well, thank you,â said I, smiling; âbut who are you?â    âI, Ramee Sawmee Dabash, Sare, come to make master proper compliment.  Very glad to see master safe on shore; too much surf, I think, and  masterâs coat leetle wet.â    âNot a little,â said I, âfor we have all had a complete sousing.â    âOh, never mind souse, Sare; I take to Navy Tavern there makee  changeeâeat good dinner. Navy Tavern very good placeâplenty gentlemen go  there.â    âWhere you please,â said I; âI am at your service.â    âVer well, Sare; but (in a tone of entreaty) you please not forget my  name, Ramee Sawmee Dabashâmasterâs dabashâI am _ver_ honest man; too  much every gentleman know me.â    Here Ramee Sawmee unconsciously spoke the truth, as I had afterwards  full occasion to discover. I was soon besieged with more of these gentry  offering their services; but Ramee Sawmee, having the best right to  pluck me, by reason of prior possession, ordered them off indignantly;  and not to incur risks by unnecessary delays, he called a palankeen, and  requested me to get into it. In I tumbled, wrong side foremost, and off  we started for the Navy Tavern. He ran alongside, not wishing to lose  sight of me for a moment, pouring his disinterested advice into my ear  in one voluble and continuous stream.    âMaster, you please take care; dis place,â said he, âtoo much dam rogue,  this Madras; plenty bad beebee, and some rascal dabash ver much cheatee  gentlemen. I give master best advice. I ver honest man.â    I thought myself singularly fortunate, in the simplicity of my  griffinish heart, in having fallen in with so valuable a character; but,  in the sequel, as has been before hinted, I discovered what, I dare say,  many a griff had discovered before, that Ramee Sawmee had a little  overestimated himself in the above particular article of honesty.    Sweltering through a broiling sun, and abundance of dust, we reached the  Navy Tavern, a building somewhat resembling, if I recollect rightly, one  of our own green verandahâd suburban taverns, in which comfortable cits  dine and drink heavy wet in sultry summer evenings. Here I found a vast  congregation of naval and military officers, red coats and blue; mates,  midshipmen, pursers, captains, and cadets; some playing billiards, some  smoking, and others drowning care in bowls of sangaree, in which  fascinating beverage, by the way, with guavas, pine-apples, &c., I also  indulged, till brought up, some time after, by a pleasant little touch  of dysentery, which had nearly produced a catastrophe; amongst the dire  consequences of which would have been the non-appearance of these  valuable Memoirs. From the Navy Tavern, Grundy and I went the next day  to the quarters appointed for young Bengal officers detained at Madras.  These consisted of some tents pitched in an open sandy spot, within the  fort, and presented few attractions; besides some small ones for  dormitories, there was a larger one dignified with the appellation of  the mess-tent. Here, at certain stated hours, a purveyor, denominated a  butler, but as unlike âone of those gentlemanly personages so called at  home as can well be imagined, placed breakfast, tiffin, and dinner, on  table at so much ahead. For two or three days I revelled in the delights  of sour Madeira, tough mutton, and skinny kid, with yams, and other  miserable succedanea for European vegetables. An Egyptian plague of  flies, and a burning sun beating through the single cloth of the tent,  made up the sum of the agreeables to which we were subjected. My faith  in the âluxuries of the Eastâ had received a severe shock, and I was  fast tending to downright infidelity on that head, when a big-whiskered  fellow, with turban, badge, and silver stick, put a billet into my hand,  which was the means of soon restoring me to the pale of orthodoxy. It  was from an eccentric baronet, to whom I had brought letters and a  parcel from his daughter in England, and ran thus:    âCol. Sir Jeremy Skeggs presents his compliments to Mr. Gernon, and  thanks him for the care he has taken of the letters, &c., from his  daughter. Mrs. Hearty, Sir J. Skeggs sister, will be happy to see Mr.  G., and will send a palankeen for him.â    I packed up my all (an operation soon effected), got into an elegant  palankeen, which made its appearance shortly after the note, and  escorted by a body of silver-stick men (for Mr. Hearty was âa man in  authorityâ), I bade adieu to the tents, and leaving Grundy and some  other cadets, though with a strong commiserative feeling, to struggle  with the discomforts I have mentioned, was conveyed at a slapping pace  to my hostâs garden residence, on the Mount Road. This was a flat roofed  building, in the peculiar style of the country, of two storiesâa large  portico occupying nearly the whole length of the front. It was  approached by a long avenue of parkinsonias, and surrounded, and partly  obscured, by rich masses of tropical foliage, in which the bright green  of the plantain contrasted pleasingly with the darker hues of the mango  and the jack. Beyond the house stretched a pleasant domain, slightly  undulating, dotted with clumps, and intersected by rows of cocoa-nut  trees. Here it constituted one of my chief pleasures to saunter, to  chase the little striped squirrels up the trees, or to watch the almost  as agile ascent of the toddyman, as he mounted by a most simple  contrivance the tall and branchless stems to procure the exhilarating  juice; or to pelt the paroquets, as they clung screaming to the pendent  leaves. To possess a parrot of my own, in England, had long constituted  one of the unattainable objects of my juvenile ambition. I had longed so  much for it, that an inordinate idea of the value of parrots had clung  to me ever since. To see them, therefore, by dozens, in their wild  state, was like in some measure spreading out before me the treasures of  Golconda.    Mr. Hearty met me at the entrance, shook me very cordially by the hand,  and taking me into the apartment where his wife and several other ladies  were sitting, he presented me to the former, by whom I was very  graciously received.    âMr. Gernon, my love,â said he, âwhom your brother, Sir Jeremy, has been  so kind as to introduce to us.â    âWe are very glad indeed to see you,â said the lady, rising and taking  my hand, âand hope you will make this house your home whilst the ship  remains.â I profoundly bowed my thanks.    âMr. Hearty, my dear, will you shew Mr. Gernon his roomâhe may wish to  arrange his thingsâand then bring him back to us?â    This was cordial and gratifying. I am apt to generalize from a few  striking particulars. So I set the Madrassees down at once as polished  and hospitable in the extremeâa perfectly correct inference, I believe,  however precipitately formed by me on that occasion. Mr. Hearty was a  fine, erect, fresh old gentleman, of aristocratic mien and peculiarly  pleasing address. His manners, indeed, were quite of what is termed the  old school, dignified and polished, but withal a little formal; far  superior, however, to modern _brusquerie_, and that selfishness of  purpose which, too often disdaining disguise, sets at nought the âsmall  courtesiesâ which so greatly sweeten existence. His wife, much his  junior, was a handsome woman of eight-and-twenty, gay and lively, and  apparently much attached to her lord, in spite of the disparity of their  years. He, in fact, was one of those rarely-seen well-preserved old men,  of whom a young woman might be both proud and fond. My host lived in the  good old style of Indian hospitality, of which absence of unnecessary  restraint, abundance of good cheer, and the most unaffected and cordial  welcome, constituted the essential elements.    In India, from various causes, perhaps sufficiently obvious, the English  heart, naturally generous and kind, has or had full room for expansion;  and the âluxury of doing good,â in the shape of assembling happy faces  around the social board, can be enjoyed, without, as too frequently the  case here, the concomitant dread of outrunning the constable, or  trenching too deeply on the next dayâs quantum of hashed mutton.  Certainly, our close packing in these densely populated lands may give  us polish, but it rubs off much of the natural enamel of our virtues.    Mr. Heartyâs house was quite Liberty Hall, in its fullest meaning. Each  guest had his bedroom, where he could read, write, or doze; or if he  preferred it, he could hunt squirrels, shoot with a rifle, as my friend,  the Scotch cadet, and I did; sit with the ladies in the drawing room and  play the flute, or enjoy any other equally intellectual amusement,  between meals, at which the whole party, from various quarters, were  wont to assemble, rubbing their hands, and greeting in that warm manner,  which commonly results where people have been well employed in the  interim, and not had too much of each otherâs company. Mr. Heartyâs  house was full of visitors from all points of the compass.    There was a captain of cavalry and lady, from Bangalore; a very  dyspeptic-looking doctor from Vizagapatam; a missionary, bent on making  the natives âall samo masterâs caste,â through the medium of his proper  vernacular; a strapping Scotch artillery cadet, before alluded to, some  six feet two, and who was my particular friend and crony, with several  others, birds of passage like myself. Amongst these, to my great delight  and astonishment, I found the lovely Miss Olivia and her sister. Now,  then, reader, prepare yourself for one of the most soul-stirring and  pathetic passages of these Memoirs. Shade of Petrarch, I invoke thee!  spirit of Jean Jacques, impart thy aid, whilst in honest but tender  guise I pour forth my âconfessions.â Yes, as an honest chronicler of  events, I am bound to tell itâthe candour of a griffin demands that it  should out. I fell over head and ears in loveââtwas a most violent  attack I had, and I think I was full three months getting the better of  it. It would be, however, highly derogatory to the dignity of that  pleasing passion, were I to trail the account of its manifestations at  the fag end of a chapter; I shall, therefore, reserve my confessions of  the âsoft impeachment,â and my voyage to Calcutta, for the next.                                         CHAPTER V.      âPeace be with the soul of that charitable and courteous author, who,  for the common benefit of his fellow-authors, introduced the ingenious  way of miscellaneous writing!ââso says the great Lord Shaftesbury; and I  heartily respond to the sentiment, that mode admitting of those easy  transitions from âgrave to gay, from lively to severe,â which so well  agree with my discursive humour. Having thus premised, let me proceed  with my story, which now begins to assume a graver aspect.    Love, that passion productive of so many pains and pleasures to mortals,  the most easily, perhaps, awakened, and the most difficult to control,  begins full early with some of us (idiosyncratically susceptible) to  manifest its disturbing effects: the little volcano of the heart (to  speak figuratively) throws out its transient and flickering flames long  anterior to a grand eruption. Lord Byronâs history exhibits a great and  touching example of this; his early but unrequited attachment to the  beautiful Miss Chaworth served undoubtedly, in after-life, to tinge his  character with that sombre cast which has imparted itself to the  splendid creations of his immortal genius. Like him (if I may dare  include myself in the same category), when but nine or ten summers had  passed over my head, I too had my âlady love,â who, albeit no Mary  Chaworth, was nevertheless a very pretty little blue-eyed girl, the  daughter of our village doctor. I think I now behold her, in the eye of  my remembrance, with her white muslin frock, long pink sash, and  necklace of coral beads, her flaxen curls flying wildly in the breeze,  or sporting in all conceivable lines of beauty over her alabaster neck  and forehead. Full joyous was I when an invitation came for Master Frank  Gernon and his brother Tom to drink tea at Dr. Anodyneâs. How motherly  and kind was good Mrs. Anodyne on these occasions! how truly liberal of  her pound-cake and syllabub!    Dear woman! spite of thy many failings, which all âlean to virtueâs  side,â in the sweet relations of mother, wife, sister, friend, thou art  a being to be almost worshipped. âTis you who hold manâs destinies in  your hands. Harden your minds without the limits of blue-stockingism, as  a counterpoise to the softness of your hearts; acquire independence of  thought and moral courage, and you will yet convert the world into a  paradise! The little bard of Twickenham has, on the whole, maligned you:  mistaken the factitious for the original; the faults of education for  the defects of nature; the belle of 1700 for the woman of all timeâbut  was still right when he said,                   Courage with softness, modesty with pride,                 Fixâd principlesâwith fancy ever new;                 Shake all together, it producesâyou.    Pretty Louisa! my first love, long since perhaps the mother of a tribe  of little rustics; or sleeping, perchance, soundly in your own village  churchyard! like a fairy vision, you sometimes visit me in my dreams,  or, when quitting for a season the stern, hard realities which environ  my manhood, I lose myself in the sweet remembrances of boyhoodâs days!  Well, this was my first grand love affair; now for my next, to which I  deem it a fitting preliminary. Griffins, look to your hearts, for you  will have some tough assaults made upon that susceptible organ on the  other side of the Cape, where (owing, I am told, to the high range of  the thermometer) it becomes morbidly sensitive. Take care, too, you do  not have to sing, with a rather lachrymose twist of the facial muscles,  âDark is my doom!â or, led on by your sensibilities within the toils of  a premature matrimonial union, you have not to inscribe over your  domicile, â_spes et fortuna valete_!â    The party at Mr. Heartyâs, or some of them, rode out every evening in  the carriage, and I generally, like a gallant griffin, took up a  position by the steps, for the purpose of handing them inâthat is, the  female portion. The precise amount of pressure which a young lady of  sixteen (not stone, but years, be pleased to understand, for it makes a  material difference) must impart to a young gentlemanâs hand, when he  tenders his services on occasions of this nature, in order to be in love  with him, is a very nice and curious question in âAmoricsâ (I take  credit for the invention of that scientific term). In estimating it,  however, so many things may affect the accuracy of a judgment, that it  is perhaps undesirable to rely on deductions therefrom, either one way  or the other, as a secure basis for ulterior proceedings. Touching the  case of the charming Olivia and myself, though there was certainly  evidence of the _high-pressure_ system, I might long have felt at a loss  to decide on the real state of her feelings, had not my hand on these  occasions been accepted with a tell-tale blush, and a sweet and  encouraging smile, that spoke volumes. Let me not be accused of vanity,  if I say, then, that the evidence of my having made an impression on the  young and susceptible heart of Olivia Jenkins was too decided to be  mistaken. I felt that I was a favourite, and I burned with all the  ardour of a griffin to declare that the â_sentiment si doux_â was  reciprocal. The wished-for occasion was not long in presenting itself.    One evening, Olivia and some of the party remained at home, the carriage  being fully occupied without them. Off drove Mr. and Mrs. Hearty, and a  whole posse of friends and visitors, to take their usual round by  Chepauk and the Fort; kissing hands to Olivia and one or two others, who  stood on the terrace to see them depart. They were no sooner gone than I  proceeded to enjoy my accustomed saunter in the coco-nut grove, at the  back of the house. There was a delicious tranquillity in the hour which  produced a soothing effect on my feelings. The sun had just dipped his  broad orb in the ocean, and his parting beams suffused with a ruddy  warmth the truly Oriental scene around. Flocks of paroquets, screaming  with delight, were wheeling homewards their rapid flight; the creak of  the well-wheel, an Indian rural sound, came wafted from distant fields,  and the ring-doves were uttering their plaintive cooings from amidst the  shady bowers of the neighbouring gardenâ                   The air, a chartered libertine, was still.    I walked and mused, gazing around on the animated scenes of nature,  which always delight me, when suddenly one of the most charming of all  her works, a beautiful girl, appeared before me. It was Olivia, who met  me (undesignedly of course) at a turn of the avenue. She appeared  absorbed in a book, which, on hearing my steps, she suddenly closed, and  with a blush, which caused the eloquent blood to mount responsive in my  cheeks, she exclaimed.    âOh, Mr. Gernon, is this you? Your servant, sir! (courtesying  half-coquettishly); who would have expected to meet you here all alone,  and so solemnly musing?â    âIs there any thing more extraordinary in it, Miss Olivia,â said I,  âthan to find you also alone, and enjoying your intellectual repast,  âunder the shade of melancholy boughs?â The Chinese, I believe, think  that human hearts are united from birth by unseen silken cords, which  contracting slowly but surely, bring them together at last. What think  you, Olivia?â I continued (we grow familiar generally on the eve of a  declaration), âmay not some such invisible means of attraction have  brought us together at this moment?â    Olivia looked down, her pretty little foot being busily engaged in  investigating the character of a pebble, or something of the sort, that  lay on the walk, and indistinctly replied, that she had really never  much considered such weighty and mysterious subjects, but that it might  be even so. Encouraged by this reply, yet trembling at the thought of my  own audacity (bullets whizzing past me since have not produced half the  trepidation), I placed myself near her, and gently taking the little,  soft, white hand which listlessly, but invitingly, hung by her side, I  said (I was sorely puzzled what to say),    âIâIâwas delighted, dear Olivia, to find you a visitor here on my  arrival the other day.â    âWere you, Mr. Gernon,â said the lively girl, turning upon me her soft  blue eyes, in a manner which brought on a fresh attack of _delirium  tremens_; ââdelightedâ is a strong term, but Mr. Gernon, I know, is  rather fond of such, little heeding their full import.â    âStrong!â I replied, instantly falling into heroics; âit but feebly  expresses the pleasure I feel on seeing you. Oh, dearest Olivia,â I  continued, all the barriers of reserve giving way at once before the  high tide of my feelings, âit is in vain longer to dissembleâ (here I  gently passed my other unoccupied arm round her slender waist); âI love  you with the fondest affection. Deign to say that I possess an interest  in your heart.â    A slight and almost imperceptible increase of pressure from the little  hand locked in mine, and a timid look from the generally lively but now  subdued and abashed girl, was the silent but expressive answer I  received. It was enough, for a griff, at least. I drew her closer to my  sideâshe slowly averted her head; mine followed its movement. The  vertebral column had reached its rotary limitâso that there was a sort  of surrender at discretionâand I imprinted a long and fervent kiss on  the soft and downy cheek of Olivia. Oh, blissful climax of a thousand  sweet emotions; too exquisite to endure, too precious for fate to accord  more than once in an existenceâthe first innocent kiss of requited  affectionâhow can I ever forget ye?               Let raptured fancy on that moment dwell,             When my fond vows in trembling accents fell;             When love acknowledged woke the trembling sigh,             Swelled my fond breast and filled the melting eye.    Yes, surely, âlove is heaven, and heaven is love,â as has been said and  sung any time for the last three thousand years; and Mahomed showed  himself deeply read in the human heart, when he made the chief delight  of his paradise to consist in it; not, I suspect, as is generally  imagined, the passion in its purely gross acceptation, but that  elevating and refining sentiment which beautifully attunes all our  noblest emotions; which, when it swells the heart, causes it to  overflow, like a mantling fountain, to refresh and fertilize all around.  No, I shall never forget the thrill of delight with which I committed  that daring act of petty larceny.    âYes,â I continued, âdearest Olivia, I have long loved you. I loved you  from the first, and would fain indulge a faint hopeâ (this was  hypocritical, for I was quite sure of it) âthat I am not wholly  indifferent to you.â    The deepest blush overspread Oliviaâs neck and face; she was summoning  all her maidenly resolution for an avowal: âDear Mr. Gernon,â she said,  âbelieve me,ââ    âStope him! stope him, Gernon,â roared a stentorian voice at this  moment; âcut the deevil off fraâ the tree!â    It was that confounded Patagonian Scotch cadet, in full cry after a  squirrel, which, poor little creature, in an agony of fear, was making  for a tree near to which we stood. âAs you were,â never brought a  recruit quicker into his prior position, than did this unseasonable  interruption restore me to mine. Olivia hastily resumed her studies and  her walk, whilst I, to prevent suspicion, and consequent banter, joined  in the chevy to intercept the squirrel, secretly anathematizing Sandy  McGrigor, whom I wished, with all my heart, in the bowels of Ben Lomond.    Reader, you may be curious to know whether Olivia Jenkins became in due  time Mrs. Gernon. Ah, no! Ours was one of those juvenile passions  destined to be nipped in the bud; one of those painted baubles, swelled  by the breath of young desire, which float for a brief space on the  summer breeze, then burst and disappear: or a perennial plant, whose  beautiful maturity passes rapidly to decay.    Our destinies pointed different ways. Too much calculation was fatal to  her happiness; too little has been, perhaps, as detrimental to mine.  Years on years rolled on, chequered by many strange vicissitudes, when,  in other scenes and under widely different circumstances, we met again:  the flush of youth had long departed from her cheeksâthe once laughing  eyes were brilliant no moreâand                        The widowâs sombre cap concealed                      Her once luxuriant hair.    âDo you remember,â said I, adverting to old times, âour meeting in the  coco-nut grove at Madras?â    âAh!â she replied, with a sigh, âI do indeed; but say no more of it; a  recurrence to the sunshiny days of my youth always makes me sad: let us  speak of something elseâthe recent, the present, the future.â                      *       *       *       *       *          There was one little thing dey do call de mosquito,        He bitee de blackmans, he no let him sleep-o-          Sing ting ring, ting ting ring ting, ting ring ting taro.    So then runs the negroâs song; and unless all is illusion and delusion,  as the Berkleyans hold, the âwhitemans,â as I can vouch from actual  experience, are equally entitled to have their misfortunes as  pathetically recorded. I believe, however, it would be as difficult to  say anything entirely original about musquitoes as to discover a new  pleasure, or the long sought desideratum of perpetual motion;  nevertheless, my subject being India, it would not be _en rÃ©gle_ to pass  them over altogether in silence; suffice it therefore to say, the first  nights of my stay at Mr. Heartyâs I was by a cruel oversight put into a  bed without the usual appendageâa set of gauze curtains. The door of my  apartment, which was on the ground floor, opened on the garden, and a  well, a pool, and a dense mass of foliage, formed a splendid  musquito-preserve, within a few yards of it. A couple of oil-lights, in  wall-shades, burnt in the room; the doors were open, the night close and  oppressive. It was truly âthe genial hour for burning,â though not  exactly in Mooreâs sense of the passage; and then such a  concerto!ââQuack! quack! quack!â said the _mezzo-soprano_ voices of the  little frogsââcroak! croak! croak!â responded in deep bass the huge  Lablaches of the poolââclick! click!â went the lizardsââghur! ghur!â the  musk-rat, as he ricketed round the room, emitting his offensive odour;  whilst                      Countless fire-flies, gems of light,                    Bright jewels of the tropic night,    spangled the trees in all directions. The idea of Aladdinâs garden, to  which his _soi-disant_ uncle introduced him, was presenting itself to my  mind, when the nip of a musquito recalled me from the fanciful to the  consideration of painful realities. The sultry heat of an Indian night  in the rains is sometimes terrific: not a breath moving; but, to make up  for it, a universal stir of reptile and insect life, with a croak, hum,  hiss, and buzz, perfectly astounding. What a prize for the musquitoes  was Iâa fine, fresh, ruddy griffin, full of wholesome blood, the result  of sea-breezes and healthy chylification! and, in good sooth, they did  fall foul of me with the appetite of gluttons. Sleep! bless your dear,  simple heart, the thing was about as possible as for St. Lawrence to  have reposed on his gridiron. I tingled from top to toe with an  exquisite tingling. In vain I scratchedâin vain I tossedâin vain I  rolled myself up like a corpse in a winding-sheet. Nought would do; so  out I jumped, half phrenzied, and dipping my hand in the oil glasses of  the lamps, I rubbed their unctuous contents over my body, to deaden the  intolerable itchingâan effect which in some degree it produced. Thus I  spent the long hours of the sultry night; towards morning, the  musquitoes being gorged, tortured into insensibility, and nature fairly  worn out, I procured a little rest.    At breakfast I made my appearance on two consecutive mornings a  ludicrous figure, the object at once of pity and amusement: eyes bunged  up, lips swelled, and cheeks puffed out, like bully _Ajax_ in _Homer  Travestie_, all of which, to a young man of decent exterior, and who, in  those days, rather valued himself on his appearance, was exceedingly  annoying. Mrs. Hearty, though with a look in which the comic and the  tragic struggled for the mastery, now took compassion on me, expressed  great regret for the oversight, and furnished my bed with a set of  musquito-curtains. âWhine away, you rascals,â said I then to the  musquitoes, exultingly; âblow your penny trumpets, you everlasting  vagabonds! you have had your last meal on me, rest assured.â What  glorious sleep I had after that!    After a fortnightâs stay at Madras, and a vain search for Ramee Sawmee  Dabash, who, having some linen of mine to get washed, and a small  balance of money to account for, thought it âtoo much troubleâ to make  his appearance, I bid adieu to my hospitable friends, reembarked on  board the _Rottenbeam Castle_, and set sail for Bengal. Our society,  officers and passengers, met again with renewed pleasure, temporary  separation being a great enlivener of the kindly feelings, which, like  everything else, require tact and management to keep them in a state of  vigour. Each, during his sojourn on shore, appeared to have renovated  his stock of ideas, and to have picked up something congenial to his  peculiar humour. The colonel had met with several old friends, and  matters to be told, âwondrous and strange,â and quite out of the common,  followed as a natural consequence. Grinnerson had had some ârare larks  and spreesâ ashore, and been âcoming the old soldierâ over some young  hands at the Navy Tavern. Miss Dobbikins criticised rather severely (as  her Bath experiences gave her every right to do) the _tournure_ of the  Madras belles, whom she had seen at balls and _conversazione_. Capt.  Marpeet, who had been at sundry drills and reviews, favoured us with  elaborate discussions on the military performances of the _Mulls_,[4]  which he considered very inferior to those of the _Qui hyes_, by whom,  to borrow his own nervous and expressive phraseology, âthey were beaten  by chalks.â Even the usually taciturn Grundy became eloquent, when he  spoke of the _luxuries_ of the tents, and his sufferings from the  musquitoes; and as for myself, being of an artistical turn, I enlarged  principally on the interesting character of Oriental scenery, but  omitting, of course, some of the peculiar attractions of the âcoco-nut  grove.â                                        CHAPTER VI.      On leaving the roads of Madras, we bent our course to the eastward. For  a day or two we had light winds and agreeable weather, and our gallant  vessel glided on, under a cloud of snowy canvas, like some stainless  swan before the dimpling breezes of a mountain tarn, little heeding the  coming danger, which was to lay all her bravery low. Soon, however, a  (by me) never-to-be-forgotten tornado, which I shall attempt to  describe, burst in upon us in all its fury.    The first indication we had of the coming storm (being still but a short  distance from Madras) was on the morning of the third day, when a few  wild clouds began to scatter themselves over the face of the hitherto  spotless sky. The breeze freshened, and an occasional squall made the  good ship _salaam_ deeply to the waves. Captain McGuffin looked to  windward, shook his head, and appeared grave. He now (for there was  evidently mischief brewing) held a brief consultation with Gillans, the  chief mate, and then immediately ordered the small sails to be taken in.  At about 8 P.M. of the same day, the fore and main topsails, as I was  told, were double-reefed, and the mainsail and maintopsail furled. The  next morning, the breeze still continued strong, and the albatrosses and  gannets, heralds of the storm, skimmed wildly over the yeasty waves. A  heavy and a turbulent sea now got up, which broke over the ship, causing  her to roll heavily, and admit much water.    âWeâre in for it, Iâm afraid,â said Grinnerson to the first mate, âand  no mistake.â    âYou may say that, when you write home to your friends,â growled forth  that sententious worthy; âIâd rather be looking at the end than the  beginning of it, I can tell you.â    Scarcely were the words out of Gillanâs mouth, when a screeching blast  flew through the shrouds and ratlines; âbang!â went one of the sails,  with the report of a six-pounder, and the _Rottenbeam Castle_ took a  deep and fearful heel to leeward.    âHowâs her head now?â said Gillans, with energy, starting up, to the man  at the wheel.    âNorth-east, and by east, sir,â was the quick reply.    âAll hands aloft,â roared the mate, âto take in mainsail;â and away went  the tars swarming up the rigging, poor little shivering middies and all,  and the perilous duty was soon performed, the sail being set to steady  her. Towards noon, the wind and sea increased, and the weather wore a  still more threatening appearance.    There are few situations which more thoroughly call forth all the noble  energies and resources of manâs mind, than the working of a vessel in a  tempest, or the ordering of troops in the heat of a battle. A cool head,  and nerves as steady as a rock, are essentially necessary in both.  McGuffin was quite a Wellington in his way; and on the present occasion,  I felt a pride in my countrymen, as I marked him, the officers, and men,  calmly preparing, as it were, move by move, for the coming onset of the  gale.    âDown royal-masts and top gallant yards,â shouted the iron-tongued  Gillans; and down, spite of the flapping of canvas and banging of blocks  and ropes, they came in a trice. This precautionary measure was not  taken a whit too soon, for the wind rapidly increased to a gale, and the  ship rolled heavily, from the violence and irregularity of the sea. At  this moment, Grundy, evidently very uneasy, and in violation of all  nautical decorum, began to whistle, less, probably, from want of  thought, than with a view to drown it. This brought the first mate upon  him immediately.    âHalloa, sir,â said he, âhavenât we got wind enough, but you must be  whistling for more? Drop that music, if you please.â    Grundy incontinently held his peace. The dismayed passengers now sought  shelter in their cabins, with the exception of a few well-muffled storm  amateurs, who clung about the cuddy doors, casting furtive glances aloft  at the wild-driving scud, and listening to the manly voices of the  officers, and seamen as heard above the roaring of the gale. A rough  cradle, and a dismal lullaby, indeed, was this, for myself and the other  nautical _infants_ on board.    At about 11 oâclock the wind increased; the decks were almost  continually submerged, the fore and maintopsails were furled, and soon  after the ship was wore, the sea running mountains high, under the fore  and maintop-mast stay-sail. The captain, having ordered the foresail to  be hauled up, the ship, in nautical language, was hove-to, the gale  blowing with uncommon fury. The sky now began to assume a most  threatening and lurid aspect. Just such a murky gloom surrounded us as  that in which Satan is finely described by Milton; when âaloft incumbent  on the dusky air,â he hovered over that âever-burningâ region, which his  âunblest feetâ were about to tread. The barometer fell rapidly, and our  courage, that is, of us landsmen, in a proportionate ratio, whilst the  vast and angry billows, like wild and maned steeds above prostrate foes,  swept in rapid succession over our quivering bark. With what intense  longing to be there did I now think of the snug green parlour and  blazing sea-coal fire at home! Ah! thought I, with a sigh, how true it  is, âwe never know the value of a friend till we lose him!â    An attempt to take in, and house, the top gallant masts, failed, owing  to the violent rolling of the ship; but every thing practicable was  effected by our indefatigable crew, although reduced by the recent  impressment, to secure the masts from the evidently increasing  hurricane. The hatches were battened down, and all made snug for the  approaching âtug of war.â All was now breathless suspense and a stern  gravity sat on the boldest countenance, when a sudden and tremendous  blast threw the ship on her beam-ends, and, with a terrific crash, the  mainmast went by the board, carrying with it, in its fall, the  mizen-yard, poop, sky-lights, hen-coops, larboard quarter gallery, and  three of our seamen. Here was âconfusion worse confoundedââpassengers  and servants making their escape from beneath the wreckâsailors  shouting, tugging, and haulingâa chaos of disasters enough to daunt, one  would suppose, the stoutest heart; but he little understands the stuff  of which English seamen are composed, who thinks there was any quailing  or relaxation of energy here. Sudden as the disaster were the efforts  made to repair it. The voice of the officer was instantly heard above  the storm, giving directions, and the active crew immediately at work,  with their axes, cutting the shrouds and ropes, for the purpose of  detaching the wreck of the mast from the vessel, which, beating  furiously against the bottom and sides, seemed to threaten her with  instant destruction.    With infinite difficulty, this operation was at last effected, and the  short but delusive âpleasures of hopeâ once more dawned upon us. On  getting clear of the wreck, the vessel partially righted, the hurricane  raging with awful violence, the sea running right over her, and  sweeping, with resistless force, every opposing article from the deck.  Our only remaining sail, the foresail, was now, with much difficulty,  taken in, and the vessel scudded under bare poles. Throughout the  remainder of the day, the hurricane raged with unabated fury: the ship  rolled gunwales under, and the water poured in through the aperture  caused by the broken mast. Never can I forget the sounds and scenes  belowâthe groaning of the timbers, the labouring and lurching of the  ship, like the throes and struggles of a dying man; the moans and cries  of the womenâstores, cargo, cabin, bulk-heads, baggage, and a cannon or  two, all loose and adrift, and dashing with frightful violence from side  to side, as if animated by some maddening spirit of destruction.    âColonel,â said Marpeet rather archly:âwho, in or out of season, loved a  jokeâto the ex-resident, clinging on close to me, his teeth chattering  like a pair of castanets; âColonel, _you_, I take it, have never seen  anything to beat this?â    âEh! whyâno! not exactly,â said the colonel, who, having the fear of  Davyâs Locker before his eyes, seemed rather loath to indulge in  anything apocryphal.    But the climax was yet to come. About 8 P.M. the wind suddenly shifted  to an opposite quarter, and blew, if possible, with greater fury. My  feelings, however, exhausted by excitement, now sank into that state of  apathetic quiescence which disarms death of all its terrors; when, in  fact, we can feel no more, but patiently await the worst. Nature thus  wisely, at a certain point, always brings insensibility to our  reliefâthe last sigh of departing hope gives birth to resignation. About  one oâclock the next day a tremendous sea broke on board, burst open and  destroyed the remainder of the poop-cabins and cuddy, and swept chairs,  tables, medicine-chests, and every movable they contained, overboard,  filling the lower deck with water; but providentially no more lives were  lost. The hurricane still raging, clouds and sea commingled; the  foremast snapped short off by the deck, and falling athwart the bows,  carried with it the jib-boom, leaving the battered hulk, with one  mutilated mast, to contend alone with the fury of the elements. A wave,  moreover, at this instant, dashed one of our boats to splinters, and  nearly made a wreck of another. Thus were the grounds of hope giving  way, like a quicksand, under our feet. To add to the intensity of our  distress, a pitchy darkness enveloped us when the foremast fell  overboard, and the sea breaking, in one continued mighty volume, over  the vessel, none could go forward to cut it away; perilous to our safety  as was its continuing attached to the bows. Oh! for the genius of a  Falconer, that I might adequately depict the horrors of the scene at  this moment! Ye âfat and greasy citizens,â ye grumbling John Bulls of  every grade, who own the great oracle of retrenchment as your leader,  little need ye grudge the soldier or sailor his hard-earned pittance,  the price of perils such as these. An inky night, whose gloom was, ever  and anon, pierced by a long, blue, zigzag flash of lightning, like one  of those wrath-directed bolts of heaven, which Martin, with such fine  effect, introduces into his picturesâthe roar of elementsâthe crippled  and lumbered vessel, rolling and plunging like a maddened steed,  encumbered with the wreck of a shattered vehicle, the few dim lanterns,  buttoned up, and hugged to the bosoms of the quarter-masters, the  dripping, comfortless, but uncomplaining tars; the captain and his  officers, muffled in fear-noughts, and the group, of which I formed one,  clinging on here and there, in order to see the worst of what we had to  encounter, formed a portion of the picture. Then the stifled sobs, and  shrieks and prayers from the women below, filling, like the voices of  wailing spirits, the momentary lullings of the gale; the violent  beatings of the fallen mast, like a catapult, against the bows, felt  through the whole vessel, and filling, even the stout hearts of the  captain and his crew with well-founded dismay at each successive thump,  formed some of its alarming accompaniments.    âGillans, we maun get clear of that mast, or âtwill be the ruin of us  all,â shouted the captain through his trumpet.    Gillans paused a moment: âIt must be done, sir,â said he; âbut how to  get to her head through this mountain sea I hardly know.â    âIâll try it,â said the gallant Grinnersonâthe wag now transformed into  the heroââhappen what may.â    Saying this, he seized an axe, and accompanied by a part of the crew,  dashed forward, holding by the shattered bulwarks as they advanced. A  few seconds of breathless suspense now elapsed, when a long dazzling  flash illumined the vessel; down she lay, deep in the trough of the sea,  whilst, by its light, a mountain wave appeared hanging over her, like a  spirit of evil, and about to break by its own enormous weight. It  brokeâdown it came, with a stunning smash, on the devoted vessel, taking  her on the forecastle and midships, sparkling and fizzing in the lurid  glare of the lengthened flash. The ship dived down, as if about to be  engulphed. âWeâre gone!â burst forth from many a voice. Slowly, however,  she rose again from the effects of the stunning blow, and another flash  exhibited a group of sailors on the forecastle, actively cutting and  hacking away at the ropes and shrouds. In a few seconds the vessel  seemed eased; the mast had been cut away, and shortly after, the heroic  Grinnerson, streaming with sea-water, was amongst us. He had escaped,  though two of the gallant fellows who had accompanied him had been swept  away to a watery grave.    âThe Lord be thankt! ye haâe done weel, sir,â said McGuffin, wringing  the second mateâs hand in his iron gripe; âye haâe saved the ship.â    The ship was now relieved, and the wind evidently falling, hope revived.  I descended below, and throwing myself into my cot, slept, spite of the  uproar, soundly till morning.    On rising, I found the wind had greatly subsided; but a heavy sea still  remained, in which our mutilated vessel rolled and tumbled like a  porpoise. All danger, however, was past, and the sea was rapidly going  down. Damages were partially repaired. The crew and passengers refreshed  themselves, and deep and heartfelt congratulations were exchanged.  Captain McGuffin, towards evening, the vessel being steadier, assembled  the crew on deck, and offered up thanksgivings to Him who âstilleth the  raging of the storm,â for our happy preservation. It was an impressive  sight to behold the weather beaten tars, their hats reverentially  doffed, ranged along the deck, their lately excited energies sunk into  the calm of a thoughtful and devotional demeanour; the pale and jaded  passengers, seated abaft, many an eye gratefully upturned; the wild sea  and battered hull; and in the centre, bare-headed and erect, the tall  and brawny, yet simple-hearted man, our commander, his prayer-book  resting on the capstan, his left hand on the leaves, and his right  stretched out, as, with a fervour which nothing but his religious  feeling could have excited in him, he read firmly, in his broad but  nervous Scotch accents, the form of thanksgiving due to Him who had  succoured us in our danger, and âwith whom are the issues of life and  death.â    To prove a particular providence is a hard and baffling task; but we can  never errâor if we do it is on the right sideâwhen we pour out our  hearts in gratitude to God, for every blessing or deliverance, come to  us by what concurrence of causes it may.    By an observation we now found we were off the Tenasserim coast. The  shipâs head was consequently put to the northward, and on we sailed  towards our destination. At length, on a fine blowing day in the S. W.  monsoon, the good ship the _Rottenbeam Castle_, after a five monthsâ  voyage, entered on the turbid waters of the Sand Heads, renowned for  sharks, shipwrecks, and the intricacy of its navigation, dashing on in  good style, despite of the battering of the late gale, under all the  sail she could carry on the foremast, and two spars rigged out as  substitutes for those we had lost. All eyes were, at this time,  anxiously on the look-out for the pilot. At length a sail was visible on  the horizon, and ere long, a rakish little brig, with the Companyâs  Yankee-looking pilot-colours flying from the peak, came bowling down,  and was pronounced _nem. con._ to be (strange misnomer) the pilot  schooner. Not a moment elapsed ere a boat, manned by lascars, put off  from her, and in a few minutes more, the rattle of oars and the  boatswainâs whistle announced its arrival alongside. The pilot,  accompanied by a bronzed stripling of fifteen, in a seamanâs round  jacket and large straw hat, and whose business was to cast the lead, now  mounted the side, and as he stepped on deck, touched his hat in a  consequential sort of manner, which plainly indicated that pilots were  no small men, in these latitudes. Mr. Merryweather, for so I believe he  was called, was one of a numerous class, variously subdivided, called  the pilot-service, whose extreme utility none can question who studies a  chart of the Sand Heads, and the embouchure of the Ganges. The seniors,  or branch-pilots, are, some of them, excellent old fellows, have their  vessels in high order, give capital _feeds_ out of silver plate, and  have generally some valetudinarian from Calcutta on board, invigorating  the springs of existence by copious indraughts of the sea-breeze. Mr.  Merryweather had quite the cut of an original, and I cannot, therefore,  resist the inclination I feel to present the reader with a sketch of  him. He was a sturdy, square-built man, of about forty, of whose jolly  countenance it might be truly said, and in the language of the Latin  grammar, â_qui color albus erat, nunc est contrarius albo_.â It  presented, at one view, one of the most singular compounds of brown,  brickdust, and purple I ever beheld; clearly indicating that it had long  been the scene of a fierce struggle for the ascendency between the skyey  influences of the Sand Heads, on the one hand, from without, and those  of aqua vitÃ¦, from within. Sun and wind, on the whole seemed to have had  the best of it; but the forces of aqua vitÃ¦ had made a most determined  stand on that elevated position, the nose, from which there appeared  little chance of their being dislodged. Our sturdy Palinurus was attired  in a camlet coat, with the uniform lion button, the colour whereof, once  blue, now exhibited in its latter days, like a dying dolphin, a variety  of interesting shades; a pair of tight nankeens, extending about  half-way down the calf, encased his lower extremities, very fully  exhibiting their sturdy and unsymmetrical proportions, in which the line  of beauty, admitting that to be a curve, had by Dame Nature been most  capriciously applied. He would have met with a distinguished reception  in Laputa, being built on strictly mathematical principles; for one leg  exhibited the segment of a circle, the other something very like an  obtuse angle. In a sinewy and weather beaten hand, âspotted like the  toad,â he grasped a huge telescope, covered with rusty green baize, the  length of which was nearly âthe standard of a man;â whilst a large white  hat, which bore nearly the same proportion to his size that a mushroom  does to its stalk, completed a manly, but not very inviting, portrait.    âMr. Merryweather, ma gude friend, Iâm glad to see ye luking sae weel,â  exclaimed our Scotch commander, who, it appeared, was an old  acquaintance of the pilotâs. âWhy, somebody telt me at Madras, that  yeâed been near deeing sinâ we were here last.â    âAy, ay, they told you right, captain; I had a very tightish touch of  the _mollera corbus_, or whatever âtis called, after you left us. Yes, I  was within a pint of getting a birth in Padree Shepherdâs godown;  howsomever, the old âooman and Dr. Dusgooly brought my head round to the  wind somehow, and now Iâm as fresh as a lark, as a man might say in a  manner, and ready for a tumbler of your toddy, captain, with as little  daylight in it as you please,âha, ha, ha!â    Thus he ran on for some time, and then in a similar style, gave us the  latest news of the presidency, which, to the best of my recollection,  consisted of a mutiny, death of a puisne judge, and a talked-of-war with  Nundy Row Bickermajeet, a potentate of whom none of us had heard before.    The captain now duly deposed, Mr. Merryweather took charge of the  vessel, and marched up and down the deck with all the confidence of a  small man invested with âa little brief authority,â now peering under  the sail, and conning the bearings of the buoys, which here and there  rode gallantly in the channel, like the huge floats of some giant  âbobbing for whale;â anon asking briskly the man at the wheel how her  head was, or thundering out some peremptory order for trimming or  shortening the sail. Thus we glided on through the turbid channel,  whilst strong ripples or long lines of surf, on either hand, with here  and there the slanting masts of a stranded vessel, indicated the  perilous nature of the navigation. At last we caught a glimpse of a  small island, but recently emerged from the waves, being like many  others at the mouths of great rivers, of rapid diluvial formation, and  immediately after, the low, marshy and jungle-covered shores of Saugor  Island broke in sight.    To those whose Oriental imaginings have led them to expect in the first  view of Indian land some lovely scene of groves, temples, and clustering  palm-trees, the sight of the long low line of dismal sunderbund and  swamp must not be a little disappointing. Saugor, however, Bengal  tigers, and the fate of young Munro, are associated subjects, naturally  blended with our earliest recollections. Full oft in my boyish days had  I gazed on a picture representing the monster springing open-mouthed on  his victim, and wondered if it would ever be my lot to visit a country  where pic-nics were disturbed by such ferocious intruders. Viewed, then,  as the head-quarters of the tigers, and the scene of this memorable  exploit of one of their body, and also as the outpost of our  destination, I deemed Saugor a sort of classic ground, and gazed upon it  with a proportionate interest. Many an eye, too, besides my own, was  bent towards the island, which wore a most sombre and miserable aspect.    Thinking Mr. Merryweather a person likely to be well informed on the  subject, I ventured to ask him, civilly, if tigers were as numerous on  the island as in young Mr. Munroâs time. I at the same time solicited  the loan of his telescope, thinking, peradventure, I might by its aid  descry a royal Bengal tiger, in full regalia, enjoying his evening  perambulation on the beach. The pilot stared at me, with as much  astonishment as the Brobdingnag did at the Splacknuck, when he heard him  talk, or Mr. Bumble, in Dickensâ admirable novel, when the unfortunate  Oliver asked for more soup; but soon settled it in his mind that I was  an arrant griffin, and that it was not worth his while to be  particularly civil to me.    âTigers!â he grunted out; âAy, ay, thereâs plenty oâ them, I dare say;  but Iâve something else besides tigers to think about, young gentleman;  and you mustnât talk to me dâye see, when Iâm engaged with a wessel. As  for the glass, itâs in hand, and youâd better ask some one else to lend  you one.â    To borrow the language of the fancy, I was regularly floored by this  rebuff, and incontinently held my peace, determining to reserve my  zoological inquiries for a fitter occasion and more communicative  person; at the same time, lost in astonishment that a man could actually  pass his life in sight of Saugor island, and yet feel no interest in  royal Bengal tigers. The delusion is a common one, and not confined to  griffins, which leads people to imagine that others must be interested  in what they are full of themselves.    The wind now suddenly rose, and the sky, which had long been lowering,  assumed an inky hue. Mr. Merryweather looked anxious and uneasy, and I  heard him observe to the captain, that we were in for a north-wester,  and that he feared it would overtake us before we reached the anchorage  at Kedgeree. What a north-wester was I did not exactly know, but the  precautionary measures taken of diminishing the sail, closing hatches  and scuttles, &c., and the appearance of the heavens, left me no room to  doubt that it was one of the various denominations of the hurricane  family.    [Illustration: Mr. Cadet Francis Gernon, anxious to discover a Royal  Bengal Tiger, falls in with a Bear]    The scene at this moment, to one unacquainted with these tropical  visitants, though rather alarming, was singularly wild and magnificent.  All around, to the verge of the horizon, the sky was of the deepest  indigo hue, whilst dark masses of rolling clouds, like hostile  squadrons, were slowly marshalling over head to the thunderâs deep  rumble and the lightningâs flash, which shot like the gleaming steel of  advancing combatants across the dun fields of death. From the setting  sun, a few long rays, like rods of gold, shot through openings of the  clouds, streaming brightly over sea and land, bringing forth the  lustrous green of the mangroves, and touching, as with a dazzling pencil  of light, the distant sail, or milk-white seabirdâs wing.    At length, the sough of the coming tempest was heard mournfully sweeping  through the shrouds, and a few heavy drops fell on the deck. The ladiesâ  scarves and shawls began to flutter, and one two hats were whisked  overboard, on a visit to the sharks. This was a sufficient hint for the  majority of the idlers, and they forthwith dived below. I lingered  awhile, and casting my eyes over the stem at this moment, beheld the  storm driving towards usâspray, screaming gulls, and tumbling porpoises  heralding its approach. In a moment it was upon us. Sheets and floods of  driving rain burst on the ship, as on she hissed through the frying  waters. Buoy after buoy, however, was safely passed, though it was once  or twice âtouch and goâ with us; and ere long, to the infinite joy of  all on board, we dropped anchor in safety off Kedgeree.    Never did I listen to more pleasant music than the rattle of the  chain-cable, as it brought us up safe and sound, or rather unsound, in  this harbour of refuge. Here, in the mouth of the Hooghly river, was  comparative calm and tranquillity, and as we cast our eyes seaward, and  saw the dark brown turbulent sea (for here it is not green) heaving and  tossing, with the surrounding tempestuous sky, and night closing in, and  contrasted our position with that of several far-off vessels, some of  them hull-down, struggling under a press of canvas to reach the safe  berth we had gained, before night and the falling tide might leave them  âoutside,â environed by perils, we could not help indulging in very  agreeable self-congratulations. âTis a sad reflection that our joys  should often derive so much of their intensity from the foil of othersâ  misfortunes; but, alas! so it is.    Here a fresh supply of fruit, and vegetables, and fish, from the shore;  a batch of Calcutta papers; and sundry other little matters, made things  very pleasant. All were âaliveâ and cheerful, and at ten oâclock I  turned in and rose in the morning like âa giant refreshed,â full of  agreeable anticipations of the scenes on which I was about to enter.                                        CHAPTER VII.      The morning after our arrival at Kedgeree I arose early, and, on coming  on deck, found the weather perfectly calm, and presenting a striking  contrast to its appearance on the previous day. A burning Bengal sun,  however, shone around in all its glory, and was reflected with painful  and dazzling brightness from the now unruffled surface of the Hooghly.  Boats, to me of singularly novel and picturesque formsâsome thatched,  others open, and all with long galley-like prows and sternsâwere moving  here and there, mingled with market-boats, laden with fruit and  vegetables, and light and graceful dingies, or fishing-canoes, floating  down with their outspread nets and dusky crews on the gentle undulations  of the falling tide. Near us, ships of various descriptions were riding  at anchor, from the stately Indiaman of those days, with her double tier  of ports, and looking like a seventy-four, to the Arab grab and  country-coaster.    This was a day of considerable bustle and excitement. The passengers  were looking up their baggage, getting out their letters, or despatching  special messengers to their friends in Calcutta. Boats from the  presidency were continually arriving alongside, freighted principally  with baboos or circars, good-looking fellows for the most part, with  huge green or yellow curly-toed shoes, and flowing muslin robes, as  light as the gossamer, and white as swansâ-down. Some came to secure  constituents; others were deputed by merchants or parties interested in  the ship or passengers; and not a few keen-witted fellows, like my  friend Ramee Sawmee Dabash, were on the look-out for âpigeons.â With all  these arrivals, our deck began to assume a very lively and animated  appearance.    I could not help being forcibly struck with the marked dissimilarity  between the two races, who, here respectively the subjects of a common  power, and from the antipodes, were engaged in objects of mutual  interest, or busy in the exchange of friendly greetings. There stood the  sturdy Englishman, with his ruddy face, iron muscles, and broad  shoulders, strong in his straightforward hyperborean honesty; before  him, like some delicate spaniel, or Italian greyhound, coaxing a bluff  old Jowler of a mastiff, were the wily Asiatics, chattering and  salaaming, fearful to offend, their slender and supple limbs all in  motion, and supplying by quickness and address the want of energy and  boldness.    The family union, which had now for five months so pleasantly subsisted  between our party on board, was about to be dissolved, and already were  their thoughts and feelings on the wing, impatient for other scenes and  objects. The cup of pleasure is seldom unalloyed, and with mine, at that  moment, mingled a drop of bitterness, as I thought that an important  scene of my life was about to close for ever, and that many of the  actors in it, with whom I had so pleasantly âstrutted my hour,â I might  never see again. To think that we are leaving even an inanimate object  for ever is a painful thought, but it acquires almost a solemnity when  man, âthe mind, the music, breathing from his face,â is the being we are  now about to quit. Honest McGuffin, methought, have I heard your broad  Scotch for the last time? Grinnerson, my merry wag, will you roast me no  more? Gillans, bluntest of seamen, will thy hoarse voice, in the  midnight watch, never again startle my ear, when through the shrouds  (rudest of Ãolians) the rough winds pipe their wild accompaniment? And,  oh! Jemmy Ducks, thou Pariar of the _Rottenbeam Castle_, thou great  conservator of chickens, shall I never again see thee scramble over the  hen-coops, or be more enlivened with a pleasant vision of thy tarred and  ragged breeks? _Sic transit gloria mundi!_    As a party of us, including the second mate, were chattering and  laughing on the deck about noon, our attention was suddenly attracted to  a handsome pinnace, with green sides and venetians, and of a light and  beautiful rig, gliding down the river, with all sail loosened, which,  however, the light winds had barely power to distend. As it approached,  we observed an old gentleman, and a numerous group of attendants on the  chut or roof. Marpeet immediately observed that we were about to be  visited by one of the Calcutta big wigs; and Grinnerson, applying the  glass to his eye, exclaimed, after a little reconnoitring and slapping  his leg with delight,    âBy the piper that played before Moses, if it isnât that old Tartar,  General Capsicum; heâll keep us all alive if he comes on board.â    The general was seated in an easy chair, smoking a magnificent hooka,  the silver chains and other brilliant appendages of which were  conspicuous even at a distance. Altogether, with his troop of  attendants, he looked not a little like the chief of Loochoo, as  depicted in Captain Hallâs voyage to that interesting island. Of the  liveried and whiskered group about him, one swung a huge crimson silk  punkah, or fan, with a silver handle, the end of which rested on the  deck; a second held an umbrella of the same colour over his head; two  more worked chowries, or whisks, to keep off the flies; and behind his  chair stood his pipeman, or hookhaburdar, a black-bearded fellow, with  his arms folded, and looking as grave and solemn as a judge. At the back  of all these again, and forming a sort of rear-guard, were a body of  mace-bearers and silver-stick men, awaiting the slightest order of the  chief. Well, this is something like Eastern magnificence, indeed,  thought Iâ_nil desperandum_ââFrank Gernon, hold up your head; you may be  a nabob yet.â    Upon the arrival of the pinnace within a very short distance of the  ship, the old gentleman, assisted by his obsequious attendants, arose  from his chair, and moving to the verge of the roof or poop, with a gait  almost as unsteady as the toddle of an infant, gave us a full view of  about as odd a figure as can well be imagined. In height, he was below  the middle size, and as thin and shrivelled as an old baboon, to the  physiognomy of which animal his own bore no inconsiderable resemblance;  indeed, till I saw him, I never thought much of Lord Monboddoâs theory.  He wore a red camlet raggie, or Swiss jacket, with blue collar and  facings, which hung in bags about him, and a white waistcoat, wide open,  from which a volume of frill protruded. His nether man was encased in a  pair of tight nankeens, buttoned at the ancle (a singular perversity  common to old gentlemen whose calves have gone to grass), and which  exhibited the extraordinary slenderness of his frail supporters in a  very striking point of view. A queue (the general being one of the âlast  of the pigtailsâ), a round hat of black silk, a good deal battered, with  a bullion loop and button, completed the outward appearance of the  Bengal veteran, who soon, however, satisfied us that, spite of  appearances, he was, as Grinnerson said, a stout-hearted old fellow,  with plenty of pluck and mental vigour still about him; one of whom it  might be said, that âEâen in his ashes glowed their wonted fires.â    When pretty close, the little old man, from whom a squeaky and faltering  treble might have been expected, astonished us by shouting out, in a  stentorian voice, and with a tone and accent smacking strongly of the  âfirst gem of the sea,â    âIs that the _Rottenbame Castle_, sur?â    Being answered in the affirmative, he continued, âIs Captain McGuffin on  board, sur?â    McGuffin, who by this time had come to the side, replied to this  question himself. Taking off his hat, and waving it, he said,    âHoo air ye, general? Iâm glad to see you, sir, luking sae weel. Will  you come on board, sir?â    âHah! McGuffin, is that you? How are you, my good sur?â returned the  general, raising his hat, too, with all the dignity of the old school,  or of the guardsman at Fontenoy. âSorry to see you in this ugly pickle,  though. Have you got my Cordalia on board?â alluding to his daughter, a  widow lady, one of our passengers from Madras, and who, at this instant,  having heard of her fatherâs arrival, rushed to the side, and kissing  one hand with _empressement_, whilst she waved her handkerchief in the  other, soon afforded him satisfactory evidence of her existence.    After some little trouble, the pinnace was safely moored alongside, and  the old general securely, though with equal difficulty, and a few  volleys of abuse to his servants, deposited by instalments on the deck.  Here, however, he appeared in some danger of suffocation, from the  vigorous embraces of the buxom young widow, who yielding to the impulses  of natural feeling, and regardless of standers-by, rushed into his arms,  and kissed him with the warmest affection, knocking off his hat by the  collision, and exhibiting to our view the generals venerable head, white  with the snows of seventy or eighty winters.    Here, then, in the shrivelled old soldier standing before me, I beheld a  warrior of the days of Clive, a last representative, probably, of a  generation long gone down to the dust, whose thoughts, dress, and  manners so essentially differed from our own, and who (all honour to  their three-cornered hats and big waistcoats!) had baffled the Indian in  the field and the cabinet, and laid the foundation of this proud  dominion, on which I was about to set foot. I looked on him with that  respect with which we contemplate a grey ruin of other days, with its  silent courts, its âbanquet-hall deserted,â and all its glorious  associations, and which long has withstood the tempests of the world.    [Illustration: General Capsicum on Board the âRottenbeam Castle.â]    After retiring to the cuddy, and some private conversation with his  daughter, the general again came on deck, and had a renewed round of  handshaking with the captain, and some other of his acquaintance, whom  he expressed himself as devilish glad to see in India again, âthe best  country in the whole world, by all thatâs good!â He concluded with a  look redolent of gunpowder and hair-triggers, though half jocular, âAnd  where is the man that will say me nay?â It was obvious at a glance the  general was what an old Scotch author calls                     A fiery Ettercap, a fractious chiel;                   As hot as ginger and as true as steel;    with not a little of that _refined savageism_ in him, which exalts the  _duello_ into the first accomplishment of a gentleman.    In Colonel Kilbaugh he recognized an old friend and brother campaigner,  and right cordial was the greeting between them. A tremendous refighting  of battles would then and there have taken place, it was quite clear,  had time allowed of it; unless, upon the principle that two negatives  make an affirmative, they should have neutralized their kindred  _fortes_. The general, amongst his peculiarities of the old school,  swore like a trooper; indeed, so free was his indulgence in that once  fashionable, but now, amongst gentlemen, exploded vice, that had he been  in England, he would doubtless have been liable to an indictment from  the Society for the Suppression of Vice, for profane swearing.    âBy Gââ, youâre looking well, though, Kilbaugh, dââd well, upon my soul;  youâve taken a new laise of your existence since you went home.â    âWhy, ehâyes,â said the little colonel, pulling up his collar-gills  complacently, and looking extremely large for his size, âwe are  certainly a new man, general; nothing like a few hogsheads of Cheltenham  waters for setting a dyspeptic man on his legs again.â    âIndeed, then thatâs true; but, Kilbaugh, though you and I have had some  rale plissant days together in old timesâeh?âyou didnât trouble the  water much then by Gââ, and liked your glass as well as any of us, and  (with a palpable wink) that same _minus_ the g, tooâ_minus_ the gâeh?  ha, ha, ha!â    With this, he made a pass at the ex-residentâs ribs with his extended  finger, which the other dexterously avoided, though with a complacent  chuckle which shewed that he was not displeased at this allusion to his  youthful frolics.    âWell,â continued the general, âyouâll put up at my place, and Iâll give  you a cast in the pinnace. By-the-bye, you liked a good bottle of beer,  Kilbaugh, I remember right well, and just now I can give you one, a rale  foamer; got in a splendid batch lately; it is from Bell, and by Gââ it  bears a bell, too.â    So he rattled on; and the ex-resident having signified his acceptance of  the generalâs offer, the trio, after a hearty leave-taking, were soon on  board the pinnace, and on their way to Calcutta.    This was the first time I had seen the Mohamedan domestics of this part  of India, and I was agreeably struck by their handsome and manly  appearance, and the becoming costume of those in the old generalâs  suite. Their turbans, vests, loose _pajammas_ or trousers, and  _kummerbunds_ or girdles, set off by their crimson belts and metal  badges, and their massive silver batons, gave them a very striking and  picturesque appearance, enhanced by luxuriant beards or mustachios,  large eyes, and high features.    There are some strange anomalies attendant on the march of civilization,  and none more so, perhaps, than the indifference, or rather want of real  taste, which nations in a high state of refinement evince in regard to  costume. Whether it is that scientific pursuits, and the busy  occupations of the thoughts on matters of high social, moral, political,  and commercial interest, leave no time for men to study the graces of  attire, or that such a study is really unworthy of, or incompatible  with, cultivated minds, or, as the Quakers think, unfavourable to  morality, certain it is that the art of decorating the person does not  keep pace with other improvements.    Our commander (finding he could not leave Kedgeree till the following  morning), Marpeet, Grundy, and I, accepted the obliging invitation of  Capt. Grogwell, of the _Rohomany_ barque, country trader, a friend of  the captain, to accompany him in his vessel, then under weigh for  Calcutta.    âI can give you a glass of grog, gentlemen, and a bit of curry, and  thereâs my cabin for you to turn into if you should stay with me  overnight,â said the frank and good-humoured sailor; âbut,â added he,  âthereâs no time to be lost for those that go, as the tideâs already on  the turn.â    A few bags and boxes were soon stowed in Captain Grogwellâs boat, and  after many warm adieus from our friends on board, and the expression of  mutual hopes that we should meet again in Calcutta, off we pushed for  the _Rohomany_ barque.    As we approached her, two or three bronzed faces, surmounted by straw  hats, rose above the side, and were directed expectantly towards us,  whilst the whistling pipe of the serang, or native boatswain, announced  the skipperâs approach alongside. We mounted through a bevy of the sable  crew, and soon stood on the deck of the country ship, just arrived from  a voyage to the Eastern Islands.    âWelcome on board the _Rohomany_, gentlemen, where I hope you will make  yourselves at home and comfortable,â said Captain Grogwell. âMy first  officer, Mr. Dobbs, gentlemen,â he continued, presenting a tall, brawny,  and fine-countenanced man. Mr. Dobbs made his best leg; was glad to see  us on board.    The lascars now began to weigh the anchor to a wild and not unmusical  chant, with an agreeable chorus of _Ya Ullahs!_ All was soon bustle, the  anchor a-peak, and the mates shouting forth their commands in the most  extraordinary lingo that ever grated âharsh musicâ on my ears.    âTrinkum Garvey de man,â said one; âGarvey brass trinkum de man,â roared  another; whilst Mr. Dobbs, in a tremendous fury (why I knew not), and  stamping like a madman, sung out âChop and string your goosey, and be  dââd to you all.â    These are a few specimens. On hearing the last, I certainly was inclined  to think that the death-warrant of one of those _capitol_ birds who feed  on our commons, and on whom our commons feed (excuse the double pun),  had been pronounced. I wish some Oriental philologist would give us a  history of this nautical jargon, which, I take it, is a sort of _olla  podrida_ of Portuguese, Bengalee, and heaven knows what dialects  besidesâthe _lingua franca_ of the Indian seas. On we glided; passed the  âsilver tree,â a singular vegetable production, composed of brick and  mortar; âDiamond Harbour,â another misnomer, but very Golcondahish in  the sound; and finally, a stiff wind setting in dead ahead, found it  impossible to get round a certain peninsula, sometimes called âHooghly  Point,â but amongst sailors, rejoicing in the less euphonious  appellation of âPoint Luff and be dââd.â There was no help for it, so  down went the anchor, and there seemed every prospect of our having to  conjugate the verb _ennuyer_ till a fresh flow of tide and shift of wind  should enable us to pass this most troublesome part of the river, and  the dangerous shoal of the James and Mary. The reader must understand  that all this was before the days of steam.    Leaving the white tavern of Fultah, where the Calcutta _bon vivant_ eats  mango-fishâthe whitebait of India,âwe soon passed Budge Budge, the scene  of the sailorâs unique exploitâa story too well known, I fancy, to need  repetition hereâand in a short time after, on turning âHangmanâs Pointâ  (where once stood an outpost of civilization), found ourselves opposite  âGarden Reach,â the sylvan vestibule of Calcutta. I have seen few sights  in my wanderings more beautiful and imposing than the approach to this  Petersburgh of the East, this magnificent capital of our Eastern empire.  On the left was the Botanical Garden, with its screen of tall dark  cypress trees; on the right, a long succession of beautiful villas,  situated amidst verdant lawns and park-like pleasure-grounds, sloping  gently down to the waterâs edge. Here the eye was caught by some pretty  kiosk or summer-house, like the _lust-haus_ of a Dutch retreat, or such  as we sometimes see in the stately gardens attached to some mansion of  the olden time here at home. There it rested on a ghaut, or flight of  steps leading to the water, with urns or balustrades, before which, in  the mellow _chiar-oscuro_ of some overhanging banyan-tree, lay moored  the elegant covered pleasure-boat of the ownerâhurrying through the  grounds, a palankeen would appear, with its scampering bevy of attendant  bearers and running peons, the huge red chattah or umbrella to shield  the master from the sun, when making his _exits_ and _entrÃ©es_, bobbing  up and downâstanding before many a porticoed mansion, gigs, or other  equipages would appear in waiting, to take the Sahibs to town, or on  their rounds of morning visits, and mingling in pleasing contrast with  the Europeanized character of these beautiful domains, the lofty palm or  kujjoor would here and there raise its head, the perch of a knot of  solemn vultures; or parting the grounds one from another, lofty fences  of the graceful and pensile bamboo, might be seen drooping in rich  clusters, like plumes of ostrich feathers. Numerous boats glided up and  down the river, with here and there a vessel like our own, obeying the  whirling impulses of the tide, and rapidly approaching its  destinationâall, in fact, bespoke the close vicinity of a great capital.    The reach nearly past, the proud citadel of Fort William broke in view,  its grinning batteries opening upon us, one after the other, and  affording a lively idea of the sort of gauntlet which an enemy might  reasonably expect, should one sufficiently hardy ever dare to confront  them. Here and there on the long-extended rampart, the sentry âwalked  his lonely round,â his musket and bayonet gleaming brightly in the  noontide rays, whilst crowds of natives, passing palankeens, and stately  adjutant birds stalking âin grey attireâ on the banks, gave life and  animation to the sceneâa few minutes more, and a long forest of  shipping, with masses and lines of stately mansions reposing under the  still calm sky, like some Grecian capital of old, bespoke the City of  Palaces, the proud metropolis of British India.    Here was a sight at which a Briton might honestly exult, and, young as I  was, I gazed with pride on this magnificent creation of my countryâs  civilization and powerâthe point from which she governs the countless  millions of the dependent Empire which Providence, for the wisest of  purposes, has submitted to her benignant sway. Old England! mighty  heart! long may thy vigorous pulsations be thus felt to the utmost  bounds of our earth! Nations, like individuals, have their stages of  existenceâtheir infancy, their manhood, and their decline; some fall  into premature decrepitude and dissolution, and leave but the memory of  evil deeds behind them; whilst others sink in glorious maturity, under  the weight of years and honours, leaving the fruits of a well-spent life  behind them, to be embalmed for ever in the hearts of a grateful  posterity. May such be thy lot, O my country!                                       CHAPTER VIII.      We dropped anchor off the city, amongst a crowd of shipping and a swarm  of boats, with which the river seemed actually alive; some of them home  along by the headlong âfreshes,â and athwart the bows of the vessel,  with fearful and dangerous velocity. I was all anxiety to get on shore;  so, without waiting for Marpeet and Grundy, who had some small  toilet-matters, &c., to arrange, I put my boxes and bags into a  _paunchway_âa native boat of a particular description, several of which  lay alongsideâand, after shaking Captain Grogwell and his mate by the  hand, thanking them cordially for their hospitality, and expressing a  hope that I should see them again before I left Calcutta, I descended  the side, and was soon on my way to the shore.    âTake care of the land-sharks, sir,â said Grogwell, as I pushed off.    âHave your eyes about you, Gernon, my boy, and take care of yourself,â  cried Marpeet, âand Iâll beat up your quarters in a day or two.â    At the Ghaut, or landing-place, to which my rowers forced their way  through a thick phalanx of boats of all sorts and dimensionsâcutters,  dingies, and jolly-boats; paunchways, budgerows, and bowlias, the two  last with painted venetians and goggle-eyed figure-headsâI landed amidst  a crowd and bobbery to which even the Tower-stairs, or the piers of  Boulogne and Calais, with all their motley and voluble groups, can  hardly furnish a parallel. Men, women, and children, sipping, dipping,  and dabbling, like ducklings in a shower; females bearing pots or jars  on their heads, and children, resembling little black monkeys, astride  on their hips; bhisties, or water-carriers, filling their bags from the  turbid tide, well seasoned with cocoa-nut husks, defunct brahmins, dead  dogs, &c.; puckalls, or bullocks, bearing huge skins of the same _pure_  element; palankeen-bearers, gabbling (to me) unintelligible abuse, in  eager competition, pushing into the very river, and banging their  portable boxes one against the other in their struggle to secure fares  amongst the frequent arrivals from the shipping; baboos,  parroquet-venders, chattah-bearers, sailors, lascars, and  adjutant-birdsâEurope and Asia commingled in heterogeneous but pleasant  confusion.    I had scarcely attained the top of the Ghaut, or flight of steps, where  I waited till my baggage was brought up and coolies were obtained to  transport it, than I found myself besieged by a bevy of fellows,  mentioned before as baboos, or sircars, and who, though of a distinct  species, I saw at once belonged to the same genus as my friend Ramee  Sawmee Dabash.    âGood marning, Sar,â said one (it was near sunset), ostentatiously  displaying his first _chop_ English, approaching with an easy bend, and  pressing his right palm somewhat gracefully to his forehead: âMaster, I  perceive, is recintly arrive at Bengal prisâdency?â    âThatâs pretty clear,â said I; âbut can you direct me to the  Custom-house, and after that to some good hotel or tavern?â    âOh, sartainly, Sar; every thing master require than I can do; meditly  box come up, I disperse off with coolie.â    âGentilman,â said another, in a milder key, âyou require âspectable  sircar; I got highest tistimonial of character; you please read this,  Sar; this from Ginânel Wilkisseen Sahib, this Wakeel Ishtivil Sahib;â  and so he ran on, murdering several other English names and titles in  succession.    A third, a wizened old fellow, with a pair of spectacles perched at the  end of his nose, proffered his services somewhat in the same way; but I  told them not to trouble themselves or me, as I had determined on  honouring with my commands the first who had presented himself to my  notice. My new _employÃ©_, who rejoiced in the pleasant cognomen of  Chattermohun Ghose, now again put in his oar:    [Illustration: Griffin on Landing besieged by Baboos.]    âMasters name, I think, will be Mr. Gernonââthe rascal had read it on my  box,ââsame gentleman as was expect by _Rottenbeam-i-castle_?â    âYes, it is indeed,â said I, astonished to find myself known; âbut how  the devil came you acquainted with it?â    âOh,â he replied, âwe always ver well know whin military gentilmen are  expected at prisâdency from ship; besideâI not know, but I think, master  will have some relation this countryâface all sameâone gentleman I know,  only more youngâleetle more handsome.â    I interposed with âStuff! none of your blarney; but, perhaps, you mean,  my uncle, Colonel Gernon,â rather pleased to meet so soon after landing  with one even amongst the natives who had probably known a relative:  young people hear so much of their uncles and grandfathers, &c., at  home, that they enter life with an idea that all the world must know  something about them.    âWhat!â exclaimed Chattermohunâwho was a thorough Don Raphael in his  way,âand with well-dissembled pleasure, âWhat Connel Gernon Sahib master  uncle? I think that all same time. Connel very good gentilman, my bist  of frindâalways he impeloy me when he come Calcutta. Connel command  Europan rigâment, I think, at Danapoor?â    âOh, no,â I rejoined; âyou mistake; my uncle has been some time dead,  and I think was never in a European regiment.â    âThat I know, Sar, ver well,â continued Chattermohun briskly, and not at  all disconcerted; âbut when live, I mean, belong native rigâment (I make  small obliteration before) that some time was that place.â    âYes, yes; he was in the native infantry, certainly,â said I; âbut where  stationed is more than I can tell. And so you really knew my uncle, did  you, eh? And think me like him? Perhaps, too, you have heard of another  relation of mine here in IndiaâMr. Duggins?â    âWhat Mr. Duggin, what was civil sarvice?â    âNo, no,â I answered; âhere in the law, in Calcutta.â    âOh! what master mean Mr. Duggin âsliciter? Yes, sar, I know him ver  well; he greatly respect-i-meâthat time he was live.â    âWhy, I trust heâs not dead?â I exclaimed, in astonishment: âhe was well  at Bombay the last accounts we had of him.â    âNo, Sar, not dead; master not underistand; I mean that time was live  here, Chowrunghee.â    Though rather green and guileless in those days, as maybe inferred from  the foregoing example, and unwilling, unless on something stronger than  mere _primÃ¢ facie_ evidence, to imagine deception; yet I began to  suspect that the rascal was humbugging me for a purpose, and was about  to let him know as much, in rather strong terms, when he adroitly  changed the key.    âMaster will be in âtillery, I think?â    âNo,â said I impatiently; âinfantry, infantry; but donât bother, and us  be off.â    âAll same,â he continued, determined to have his talk out; âmaster will  require plenty thing, all which I can supplyâbist of qualityâif require  too good-i-sarvant: will you take this man?âplenty character he got.â    So saying, he presented to my notice a queer, raffish-looking fellow,  with a bush of hair and a black beard, and dressed in quite a  different style of costume to that of the others. This worthyâa  Mussulman khidmutgar or footmanâmade his salaam, and thrust into my  hand two or three well-soiled certificates, which stated that Ramjahn  Khan (_ang._ Rumjohnny,) had served the writers (captain this and  lieutenant that) with zeal and fidelity, and to their perfect  satisfaction. Of these âcharacters,â by the way, all domestics have a  stock, or, if not, they borrow or hire them (being as accommodating  one to another in that way, as was the Irish priest who, as related by  the pleasant author of _Wild Sports of the West_, on a pinch, and to  save appearances, gave his friend, the Protestant curate of Connemara,  the loan of his congregation), with sufficient information touching  the subscribers to allow of some slight questioning, though by no  means of an adroit cross-examinationâa thing at this time, however, in  the native language, quite beyond my powers, albeit I had puzzled my  brains a little on ship-board with a certain celebrated philologistâs  orthoepigraphico-pseudolatitudio-logical works, and could patter a few  sentences of Hindostanee in the â_Myn nuheen kitai hoon_â style, in a  way really to âastonish the natives.â    To cut the matter short, however, I hired Rumjohnny on the strength of  his testimonials; and having now got my baggage all up, moved off with  him and Chattermohun Ghose to the Custom-house. Having arranged matters  there, I proceeded through the thronged streets of Calcutta to a tavern  or punch-house, somewhere in the aristocratic region of Ranamoody Gully;  a sort of place of entertainment which, in those days (though, from  their improved character the case is now, I understand, different), it  was considered quite _infra dig._ in a gentleman to visit. However,  being a griff, I knew nothing of this, and if the case had been  otherwise, I should have been without an alternative. Dirty tablecloths,  well spotted with kail and mustard; prawn curries, capital beef-steaks,  domestics of the cut of Rumjohnny, a rickety, rusty, torn  billiard-table, on which, day and night, the balls were going, lots of  _shippies_, and a dingy bed, were the leading features of this  establishment, not forgetting clouds of voracious and well-fleshed  musquitoes, to which those of Madras were a mere joke.    I shall not inflict on the reader a dry detail of the occurrences of the  next three days; let it suffice to state, that at the end of that  period, having duly reported my arrival, &c., I found myself in  possession of an advance of 150 sicca rupees, sterling money of Bengal,  four bare walls and a puckah floor in the south barracks of Fort  William, and about to fit up the same in the first style of griffinish  fashion, under the able direction of Chattermohun Ghose.    The south barracks is one of several ranges within the Fort, and  allotted principally to the accommodation of unmarried subs. Like the  Burlington Arcade, it has a long passage down the centre, into which the  doors of the several quarters open; but here the resemblance ceases.  Here I had a practical illustration of the ill-working of the social  system, the living in a species of community under the present  discordant and defective state of our feelings and habits. The passage  was sounding and reverberating, and each occupant of a quarter had much  of the benefit of his neighbourâs flute, fiddle, or French horn, whether  âiâ the veinâ for harmony or not; shoe brushings, occasional yells of  servants undergoing the discipline of fist or cane, jolly ensigns and  cadets clattering up and down, cracking horsewhips, whistling the  â_Flaxen-headed Cow-boy_â or â_Begone Dull Care_,â the arrival of files  of coolies laden with purchases from the China Bazaar or Tullochâs  Auction Room, pleasantly varied by interminable wranglings on the part  of masterâs sirdar or bursar, touching payments and _dustoorie_, or  custom; payees urging pleas in deprecation of abatement, sirdar  overruling the sameâconstituted a few of the _dÃ©sagrÃ©mens_ of a  south-barrack life. The optical department was not less varied and  novel; but it could be shut out at pleasure, an advantage not predicable  of the former.    The aspect of the passage varied with the hour; he who strolled down it,  about the hour of dawn, or a little after, might catch glimpses, through  half-opened doors, of all stages of the toilet, from soap-suds and  dressing-gowns, to what painters term the â_ultima basia_â or finishing  touches; possibly, too, he might have a peep at the ensignâs lady, âthe  soldierâs bride,â divested of all the romance with which song-composers  and novelists are wont to invest her; hair _en papillottes_, sleeves  tucked up, and washing Augustus or Tommy. At ten, the scene was changed;  without the doors, on the ground, might be seen a goodly display of  trays, with egg-shells, fish-bones, rice, muffin, and other wrecks of  breakfast; sweepersâcertain degraded menials, âall same caste as  master,ââsquatting near and waiting for the said remnants; hookhas or  kulians in course of preparation for those who indulged in the luxury of  smoking; and here and there, perhaps, a sergeant, havildar, or strapping  grenadier sepoy, waiting for the summons from within to give this  morningâs report:ânoon and evening, tiffin and dinner, each brought its  appropriate proceedings, and varied the aspect of the common passage,  which will long, with the force of a first impression, remain strongly  engraven on my memory.    Of late years, with the view of protecting young officers on their  arrival, from those impositions, scrapes, and embarrassments, to which,  owing to their youth and inexperience, they were formerly exposed, the  Government has considerately created an appointment, called the  âsuperintendent of cadets,ââa measure well calculated to mitigate the  evil.    The system of sending youths to India at the early ages of fifteen or  sixteen, appears to me to be one fraught with evil, against which its  advantages weigh but as dust in the balance. At that early age, the  character and principles are generally quite unformed, and, intoxicated  on becoming uncontrolled master of himself, emancipated from the  thraldom of home or school, the cadet launches or did launch (unless, in  this âgo-aheadâ age, things have greatly altered) into idleness,  dissipation, and frivolity, feeling through life (if not cut off in his  prime) the effects of habits and follies which, under all circumstances,  and knowing youthâs plastic nature, it was not probable he would avoid.    Often the finest natures are the first to fall victims to the absence of  salutary restraint, or they plough their way to wisdom through bitter  experience, finding that âgem above priceâ when it is probably too late  to be of use to them. The wildnesses and consequent _escapades_ of such  boys have tended to lower the European character very considerably in  the estimation of the natives; and the sepoys, and above all, the  veteran native officers, must, and I am convinced do, feel strongly  their being subjected to the control and caprice of such striplings. It  is, perhaps, an unavoidable consequence of our anomalous rule in India,  that the native should in no case be allowed to command the European;  but, wherever possible, we should at least avoid placing hoary age and  madcap inexperience in such a degrading juxtaposition. I have known such  youths (truth obliges me to include myself amongst the number) order  about, and not unfrequently use harsh and unbecoming language to  venerable native officers, whose silver beards, and breasts covered with  medals, spoke of many a campaign, and services rendered to the state,  before probably even the striplingâs sire was in existence. As the  empire of opinionâthe awe which our superior energy and science have  inspiredâdies away, and even now it is on the waneâit will be well to  have a store of affection on which to fall backâan anchorage in the  hearts of the people of India, when our power over their prejudices has  relaxed its hold.    Chattermohun Ghose, having, as a preliminary proceeding, given me a list  of things which I _must have_âBengal indispensablesâand having been duly  authorized to procure the same, he very soon made his appearance with  about a dozen and a half of coolies or porters, bearing, amongst other  articles, a camp-table, a cane-bottom sleeping-cot, a _setringie_, or  cotton carpet, about one-third the size of my room, two chairs, some  Chinese chinaware, and copper cooking-utensils, and a huge basin,  something of the shape of Mambrinoâs helmet, on an iron tripod stand,  which it puzzled me sorely to guess the use of.    âWhat do you call this, Chattermohun?â said I; âis it a chafing-dish, or  what?â    âChafey-dish! no, Sar; that call _chillumchee_, for wash hand, with  ablutionâall gentilmen have chillumchee.â    The appendages of the toilet, by the way, and the manner in which it is  performed, in India, amongst Europeans, differ so essentially from those  of home, that they excite considerable surprise in the new comer.    âMaster, I think, will want milâtary coat,â said my grand purveyor!    âFaith! thatâs true,â said I; âand it reminds me that I have some red  cloth, furnished by Messrs. Welsh and Stalker, for the express purpose.â    âVer well, Sar; then I bring dhirgee (tailor), make up in room; same  time, I bring small piece yellow-cloth for facing; also one _ishilki_  sash, and regâlation sword, all complit.â    âBring a tailor!â said I; âwhat, do your tailors here go out to work?â    âYes, Sar; this custom this contree; not all same Calcutta as Europe.â    âSo I perceive,â I replied.    The tailor shortly after made his appearance, squatted himself  cross-legged in the apartment, and was soon hard at work at my red  jacket. He was a little old fragile fellow, who sat and plied his  needle, the only instrument he seemed fitted to wield, with an air of  apathetic quietude and resignation, which it seemed as if no conceivable  movement of the outside world could for a moment disturb, and which, to  one of my then mercurial temperament, was utterly astounding. This  little fractional portion of humanity, who was bent from age or  infirmity, took my measure with exceeding gentleness, and I think I now  see him with the few scanty hairs of his grey moustache, and his thin  horny nose, pinched by a pair of spectacles secured by a thread pinned  to the front of his turban, as he moved silently about me, in the calm  exercise of this incipient act of his vocation. Poor little old Kalipha!  Long since, doubtless, hast thou closed the âeven tenor of thy way;â thy  quiet, inglorious, though useful occupation; and added thy handful of  soda and potash to the ever-changing bosom of old mother-earth!    After having established myself pretty comfortably in the south  barracks, I despatched my letters of introduction to the several parties  to whom they were addressed; amongst the number was one to General  Capsicum. A few were from weighty and influential persons at home, and  all had thumping big seals, and âfavoured by Mr. Cadet Gernonâ written  in the corners. I used to reckon them up about once a week on  ship-board, as a miser counts his treasures; speculating on their  contents, and building _chateaux en Espagne_ touching the pleasant  results which would, I imagined, doubtless follow their delivery. This,  thought I, constructing my airy fabric after the manner of Alnaschar,  and gazing complacently on my _cheval de bataille_, my âgreat gun,â  furnished by a certain member of the peerage, this will inevitably bring  an aide-de-camp, post-haste, to invite me to the Government-house. I  shall be placed on the staff, wear a cocked-hat and aiguilettes, carve  the hams and turkeys, laugh at the Governor-generalâs jokes, carry the  Governor-generalâs ladyâs prayer-bookâlive in clover, loved and  respected, the pet and confidential friend of the family: a capital  appointment will follow in due course; wealth, honour, will pour upon  me; and, to crown my felicity, some high-born damsel will eventually  become Mrs. Gernon! Ye gods! what a career of prosperity did I picture,  as I contemplated that massive letter with its coronetted seal and crest  (an ominous griffin) all _proper_. Heigho! Four dinners, three  breakfasts, and a tiffin, were all I gained by the whole batch of  introductions; and as for the Governor-general, I grieve to say, that I  found him lamentably deficient in that penetration and power of just  appreciation of character for which I had given him credit.    I was sitting in my barrack-rooms next morning after breakfast, amusing  myself by pitching bones and crusts out of the window to a bevy of  adjutant-birds below, opening their jaws expectingly, or clattering  their huge beaks whilst contending for a bone, with the sound of  marrow-bones and cleavers, when the door opened, and, to my agreeable  surprise, in walked Captain Marpeet, his face radiant with smiles. A  cordial greeting followed for, though coarse and illiterate for a man in  his station, Marpeet was a warm-hearted, blunt, and generous fellow, and  I had a sincere regard for him. Being an âold hand,â he assumed the  Mentor towards Grundy and me, to which office, as it was not often  offensively obtruded, I quietly submitted, with proper griffinish  humility.    âWell!â said he, looking up and down and round about, âso here you are,  all snug and tight, regularly boxed up in this noisy hole?â    âAny thing by way of exchange,â I replied, âafter five months on  ship-board; but to tell you the truth, it has its merits, and I rather  like it on other grounds. Here, you see, I am, with all my comforts  about me,â pointing rather ostentatiously to my two chairs, cot, and  camp-table, and to my brazen chillumchee, in radiant brightness standing  in the corner, âand from these, my head-quarters, I mean to sally out  ever and anon, to mingle a little in the gay world of Calcutta, before I  start for the Upper Provinces.â    âWell,â said Marpeet, laughing; âI see, âfor a griff,â that you have a  pretty good notion of things in general, and I donât care if I join you  in a spree or two before I leave. You griffs require an âold handâ to  look after you, or you will be always doing some soft thing or another.  But have you been playing a knife and fork anywhere yet? been to any  grand âfeedâ since you arrived?â    âDinners and parties, eh? No, not as yet; but there is abundance of time  for that, for it was only yesterday that I fired off a grand salvo of  letters, which will doubtless, in due time, bring invitations âas thick  as leaves on Vallombrosa.ââ    âLeaves on! pshaw! canât you say âblack-berriesâ at once? I wish,  Gernon, you were not so confoundedly poetical; I hate poetry mortally;  it is griffinish; give me matters of fact, something I can understand.  Dundas, or a number of the _Sporting Magazine_, or the like.â    âThereâs no help for it,â said I; âitâs my nature, and nature we may  modify, but cannot radically change.â    âPhilosophizing; thatâs worse still. But, joking apart, donât be too  sure of the invitations, or you may reckon without your host. Iâm an  âold handâ (Marpeetâs everlasting boast), and have seen a little of  Calcutta in my time, and I know, whatever the folks once were, they are  now becoming most infernally _pucka_ (stingy), and will soon, I verily  believe, be as bad as they are in England, where a leg oâmutton goes  through the nineteen manÅuvres before it is dismissed, and a man thinks  he confers an everlasting obligation if he asks you to dinner.â    âHa, ha, ha! you old splenetic _Qui Hye_,â I exclaimed, âyou are too  hard on us âEnglishers;â you donât consider the difference of  circumstances, and that, where mouths are many and legs oâmutton few, we  must resort to expedients to square supply and demand.â    âBut,â resumed the rough-spun captain, ânow let me fulfil the principal  object of my visit, which is to congratulate you.â    âFor what?â I asked.    âWhat? why are you so ignorant, so out of the world, as not to know that  you are promoted?â    âPromoted!â exclaimed I; âwhy Grinnerson said I should be in luck if I  got my commission in five years.â    The captain put a _Gazette_ into my hand, doubled it up in a compact  form, and, striking a particular portion _con spirito_ with his  forefinger, âRead that,â said he.    I took it in a sort of ecstacy, caught a glimpse of my own name.  Yesâthere I was, actually in print: âMr. Gernon, appointed by the  Honourable Court of Directors a cadet on this establishment, having  reported his arrival at Fort William, is admitted to the service  accordingly, and promoted to the rank of ensign.â    âYoics! full ensign!â shouted I, springing up, snapping my fingers, and  capering round the room arms a-kimbo, hip and toe, like a sailor dancing  a hornpipe, to the infinite astonishment of Marpeet, who thought I had  been bitten by a scorpion or snake.    âHey! hey! whatâs the matter Gernon? are you mad, you Griff, are you  mad?â    âI am mad, old square-toes; come along,â said I, hauling him out of his  chair; âcome and rejoice with me. Promoted already! Yoics! Tally-ho!â    In the midst of our uproar and saraband, Grundy entered, and gazed with  open mouth, like one moonstruck, at our mad dervish dance. His  appearance, however, calmed any ebullition, and pushing Marpeet into his  seat, I sunk into mine.    âWhatâs the matter?â said he.    âWhy, Iâm promoted, my honest young ploughshare,â said I, âthatâs all;  we were footing a jig on the strength of it. I dare say you will find  your name there too.â    âOh, yes,â observed Marpeet; âthe whole batch of the last griffs are in  the general orders. There,â added he, tossing the paper to Grundy,  âyouâll find yourself there, farmer, at full length.â    Grundy took the paper, and beheld his own mellifluous name; but his  pleasure manifested itself in a different manner from mine; he âgrinned  horribly a ghastly smile.â    âAs you are so fond of dancing,â said Marpeet, âwhat say you to joining  a hop to-morrow evening?â    âWith all my heart,â said I; âalways ready for a âtrip on the fantastic  toe;â but who is your friend?â    âWhy,â rejoined the captain, âI have a âprovokeâ here from the mistress  of the Kidderpore establishment for the orphan daughters of officers  (where, by the way, I expect my young Mogulanee will figure some of  these days), to attend a dance to-morrow; they have a ball there once a  fortnight (I believe), to show off the girls, and give them an  opportunity of getting spliced.â    âThatâs a new feature of schools; in England, if I remember rightly, the  efforts of the mistresses tend all the other wayâto keep the girls from  getting married.â    âThat,â said Marpeet, âwould never do in India, where women are thinking  of getting buried about the age at which they talk of being married in  lat. 50Â° N. Yes, this is the place for the man who wants a wife, and  wishes to be met half-way, detesting, like me, the toil of wooing. There  he can go, and if he sees a girl he likes, good fore-hand, clean about  the fetlock-joints, free in her paces, sound and quiet, and not too long  in the tooth, if not bespoke, heâll not find much difficulty in getting  her. But if you and Grundy will go, Iâll get you smuggled in somehow or  other, and will call for you in proper time to-morrow.â    âThank you,â said I; ânever fear for me, for Iâm all anxiety to see  these young ladies of the equestrian order, whom you so pleasantly  describe. Besides, old Stultz, here in the corner, has just finished my  red coat, and I am all anxiety to sport it for the first time.â    âWell, good-bye, lads,â said the captain; âIâm off to Tullohâs auction,  to see if I canât pick up a cheap buggy, and a few other things I want.â    So saying, he disappeared, leaving Grundy and me to ruminate on the  foregoing matters.    âGrundy,â said I, after a pause, âyou must really get a red coat, sword,  and sash, and make yourself look like a Christian, if you go to this  ball to-morrow night; excuse my giving you a hint.â    âIâm afraid thereâs not time for it,â said Grundy, âand I have nothing  of the sort as yet.â    âWell, leave it to me; Chattermohun is a sharp fellow, at a pinch; and  Iâll engage, with his assistance, to rig you out for the evening.â                                        CHAPTER IX.      Captain Marpeet made his appearance at the hour appointed on the  following evening, and off we started for the Kidderpore school, which,  by the way, is, or was, a rather large and imposing structure, at some  distance from Calcutta; mussalchees, or link boys, with blazing  flambeaux, scampering ahead in good, tip-top style.    Having passed the bazaar, we turned sharply from the main road, into a  pretty extensive compound or domain, and soon found ourselves before the  portico of the school, amongst buggies, palankeens, and other  conveyances appertaining to visitors who had preceded us. Leaving our  palankeens, we entered the house, passed through several rooms, one of  them devoted to refreshments, and partly filled with gay Lotharios, some  few military, the rest belonging to the orders âshippyâ and âcranny,â[5]  and finally entered the ball-room. This we found thronged with dancers,  in a blaze of light, and resounding to the merry notes of a band, which,  though not exactly equal to Weippertâs, seemed, nevertheless, as a  locomotive stimulus, to be quite as effective. The country-dance then  flourished in its green old age, and the couples at the Kidderpore hop  were flying about in great styleâpoussette, hands across, down the  middle, and back againâevincing, in spite of the temperature, all that  laudable perseverance so essential to the accomplishment of such  laborious undertakings.    Marpeet, at my particular request, and to keep us in countenance, wore  his uniform, though he had previously declared (considering the season)  that it was a most griffinish proceeding to sport broadcloth, and  decidedly against his conscience. âYou griffs, however,â said he âwill  have your way, and we must humour you sometimes.â As for myself, in my  scarlet raggie, brimstone facings, black waist-belt, and regulation  sword, in my own opinion I looked quite the god of war, and was fully  armed for execution.    What an era in the life of a soldier is his first appearance in  regimentals, âhis blushing honours thick about him!â how he then pants  for love and glory; the tented field and the clash of arms! At forty or  fifty, possibly, if of a thoughtful vein, his sword converted to a hoe  or pen, a mighty change comes oâer him, and he thinks, perhaps, that he  might have done better had he stuck to a black or a blue one. Sometimes,  it is true, when warmed with a flicker of his youthful fire, like Jobâs  war-horse, he loves to âsnuff the battle from afar,â and âsaith to the  trumpets, âha! ha!ââ But, mainly, war delights him no more, for he sees  the wide-spread evils which lurk under its exciting pomp and  meretricious glitter, and his heart and mind yearn towards those more  ennobling pursuits and occupations, which tend to elevate his species,  to give to the intellectual and moral their due ascendency, and which  speak of âpeace and good-will to man.â    The dancers being in motion, we did not advance, but contented ourselves  with occupying a position by the door, and leisurely surveying the  scene. At one end of the apartment, on chairs and benches, sat certain  elderly matrons, amongst whom were the superiors of the establishment,  looking complacently at the young folks, and calculating in all  probability the amount of execution likely to result from the eveningâs  amusements.    The young ladies, however, whose sylph-like forms were gliding through  the mazes of the dance, were the âorient pearls at random strung,â which  principally attracted my attention. As the flush of a summerâs noon  fades by insensible degrees into the ebon shades of night, so did the  complexions of these charming damsels graduate from white to black.  Youth, however, smiling, buxom youth, like the mantle of charity, covers  a multitude of defects, or, if I may help myself to another and apter  simile, possesses an alchymic power, which converts all it touches to  gold. There were eyes, teeth, sportive ringlets, and graceful forms  enough, in the Kidderpore ball-room, stamped with all its freshness, to  atone for the darker shadings of the picture.    For the first time, indeed, though previously imbued with the common and  illiberal European prejudice against black, I began to experience a  wavering, and to think that dark languishing eyes and a dash of bronze  imparted what is often wanted in English beauties, somewhat of soul and  character to the countenance. Music, lights, the excitement of the  ball-room, are, however, it must be confessed, sad deceivers, producing  illusions full oft, which painfully vanish with the morningâs light. For  young ladies of thirty or thereabouts (an age, though now-a-days, I am  credibly informed, never attained by spinsters), the ball-room and its  factitious glare have some decided advantages. By day, Cupid, the sly  urchin, can only make his attacks from smiles and dimples; but by night,  at a pinch, he may launch a shaft with effect even from a wrinkle.    The dance at length ceased; beaux bowed, ladies courtesied, and the  throng broke into couples, and promenaded the apartment. Exhausted  belles sunk into seats, whilst attentive youths fanned and  _persiflaged_, laughed at nothing, and studied âthe agreeable.â Such was  the posture of affairs, when the head of the establishment, a lady of  about five-and-forty, of pleasing appearance and address, seeing we were  strangers, approached, and kindly bade us welcome. There was an  amiability, and at the same time a firmness and decision in her manner,  a happy admixture of the _suaviter_ and _fortiter_, which showed that  she was peculiarly well qualified for the arduous task she had to  perform of presiding over this establishmentâa sort of nunnery  travestied, in which perpetual celibacy formed no part of the vows, and  the vigils differed widely from those which âpale-eyed virgins keepâ in  the gloomy seclusion of the convent.    âWould you like to dance, sir?â said the lady, addressing herself to  Captain Marpeet.    âNo, I thank you, maâam,â said my blunt companion; âI am a little too  stiff in the joints, and my dancing days are all over.â    The fact was, that Marpeet had passed five consecutive years of his life  in the jungles, where, as it frequently happens in India, he had  acquired what, for want of a better term, I will call a _gynophobia_, or  woman-horror, which the occasional appearance of a spinster in those  deserts wild rather tended to confirm than allay. A short residence in  England had, it is true, in some degree, moderated this dread of the  respectable portion of the softer sex; but still much of it remained,  and he shunned with morbid aversion all situations imposing the painful  necessity of whispering soft nothings and âdoing the agreeableâ with the  ladies. The good dame of the school smiled expressively on receiving  Captain Marpeetâs answer; it was a smile which said, as plain as smile  could speak, âYou are an odd fish, I see, and one on whom pressing would  be quite thrown away.â    âPerhaps,â said she, turning to me, âyou will allow me to introduce you  to a partner, and if so, I shall have great pleasure in presenting you  to one of our young ladies?â    I had none of Marpeetâs scruples, expressed my acknowledgments, accepted  her offer, and was led full clank across the ball-room, and presented in  due form to Miss Rosa Mussaleh, as an aspirant for her fair hand in the  ensuing dance. Miss Rosa Mussaleh was a fine bouncing girl of eighteen,  still in high blow from the effects of her recent exertions. Form  unexceptionable: complexion rather tending to a delicate saffron,  bespeaking plainly her Asiatic maternity.    âIf not engaged, Miss Rosa,â said the school-mistress, presenting me,  âEnsign Gernonâ (I had previously communicated my name and _rank_,  though there was not much danger of mistaking me for a major-general)  âwill be happy to dance with you.â    âI shall be ver happie; I am not engaged,â said Miss Rosa, in a singular  variety of the Anglo-Saxon tongue called the _Cheechee_ language  (Hindustanee idiom Englished), then new to meâa dialect which  constitutes a distinguishing mark of those born and bred in India, and  the leading peculiarity of which consists in laying a false emphasis,  particularly on such small words as _to_, _me_, _and_, &c. The lady of  the establishment having performed her _devoir_, as mistress of the  ceremonies, made a courteous inclination, and withdrew, leaving us to  ourselves.    As a rather precocious juvenile, I had danced with some of the fair and  well-born damsels of my own land at Bath, Clifton, and elsewhere, and  was, therefore, not to be daunted with the mahogany charms of Miss R.  M.; so, _sans cÃ©rÃ©monie_, I dashed into conversation.    âYou have a great many charming young ladies here,â said I.    âOh, yes,â said my partner, âgreat manie; but they are not all here;  _the_ little girls are gone _to_ bed. Do you then admire our young  ladie?â    This was rather a pointed question; but I replied without hesitation,  âOh, excessively; there appear to be some lovely creatures amongst them,  and (giving a flourish) with charms enough to move the soul of an  anchorite.â    âOh,â said Miss Rosa, with a smile and downward look, wishing to be  complimentary, âI think dey are more fond of the military.â    I was on the point of emitting that expressive note of  astonishmentâ_whew!_ but checked myself.    âI think,â said I, âyou rather mistook me, though I can hardly regret  that which has been the cause of so flattering an admission, but I  alluded to an ascetic.â    âAsiatic!â said the young lady, with some hauteur, and a toss of the  head, âno native come to these ball, I assure you.â    I could not suppress an emphatic âhumph!â    The fiddles now began again; I presented my arm, divested myself, though  with reluctance, of my trusty Solingen blade, and took my place in the  set. A tremendous long set it was, and after slaving for half an hour, I  found myself at the head of it. Grundy, with a face like that of the  Marquess of Granby on a sign-post, standing next to me, and streaming  like the apotheosis of a river god.    âWell, how do you get on, Grundy?â said I.    âOh, itâs cruel hot work,â said he, with a sigh, which was perfectly  heart-rending.    âHot, indeed,â I rejoined, giving sigh for sigh; âthey donât catch me  dancing again in a red coat.â    If working up the dance was fatiguing, the going down it was still more  so. My partner, a practised hand, skipped about without the smallest  signs of fatigue, whilst I, reeking from every pore, was dragged up and  down and whirled round and about till my head spun, and I thought I  should have verily gone into a fit, or sunk from sheer exhaustion on the  floor. I did, however, contrive to hold out till we finished the dance,  five-and-twenty couples at least, when, with a staggering bow, I  tendered my arm and led my partner to her seat.    âAre you fond of dancing?â said she, with the coolest assurance.    âA little of it,â said I, with a sigh, âwhen in practice, the set not  too long, and the weather not too hot.â    A gentleman, chained, ringed, and be-broached, stout and bronzed, now  came up, and engaged my partner for the next dance, chatted for some  time with the air of an old acquaintance, gave a âbye-byeâ sort of a  nod, and passed on.    âDo you know Captain Trinkum?â    âNo,â said I; âwhat does he belong to?â    âTo the _Rustomjee Bomanjee_,â said she.    âThe _Rustomjee Bomanjee_,â I rejoined; âpray what regiment is that?  some irregular corps, I suppose.â    This remark of mine set her off in a violent fit of laughter, of which  (rather confused) I begged to know the cause.    âItâs a country ship,â screamed she, ânot a regiment.â Going off again  at a tangent, âOh, now I see you are a griffin.â    Thus she balanced the anchorite account, and turned the tables. I canât  say I was sorry when he of the _Rustomjee Bomanjee_ came smirking up,  and relieved me from the raillery of Miss Rosa, who, though herself  guilty of corrupting the kings English, was an arrant quiz, and not  disposed to spare my griffinish blunders.    Marpeet now joined me, and after a little banter touching the style in  which Miss Rosa had trotted me about, proposed an adjournment to the  refreshment-room. To this I joyfully acceded, suggesting that it would  be a charity to take poor Grundy with us, if his dissolution had not  already taken place.    âCome, Grundy,â said Marpeet; âcome along with us; weâre going to  victual and refit, and would recommend the same to you, for you seem in  need of it.â    Grundy assented with pleasure, and, linked arm-in-arm we entered the  refreshment-room.    Here was a scene of considerable bustle; some were preparing acidulous  compounds for the ladies in the ball-room; others doing the like for  themselves. As we entered, a staid and exemplary young man, with his  cargo of negus and cake, balancing the same with the nicety of a  juggler, was making his way out, when in banged a six-foot ensign to do  the bidding of his fair inamorata, and charged with her fan and gloves,  and going full butt against the exemplary beau, upset both negus and  cake. The ensign, a flighty fellow in every respect, made a hasty  apology, and off, leaving the beau to wipe his waistcoat and repair the  damages as best he might. Knots of young fellows were there, laughing,  eating sandwiches or brewing negus, lounging, and clanking their swords.  Native servants belonging to the visitors or the establishment were  bustling about, and making themselves useful; whilst here and there, in  a corner, and availing herself of the solitude of a crowd, a young lady  might be seen, her back against the wall, listlessly sipping her negus,  or balancing a spoon over a jelly-glass, and listening, with downward  look and in mute entrancement, to some handsome _militaire_, whilst he  was pouring into her attentive ear the âleprous distilmentâ of honied  words.    Recruited and refreshed, we returned to the ball-room, and in spite of  my recent resolution, I again joined the dance, which was kept up till a  late hour, when my friends and I returned to my room in the fort, where,  fairly _done_ up, I betook myself to rest, the fiddles still sounding in  my head, to dream of Miss Rosa, and all I had seen and heard; and so  terminated my first ball in the East.    The Kidderpore hops, I hear, are now no more; from which I conclude that  some other matrimonial plan has been devised for disposing of the young  ladies, more in consonance with the refined delicacy of the age, which,  though recognizing the necessity of matrimony, seems to discountenance  any expedient which smacks of the slave-market.    On the following evening, Captain Marpeet, according to engagement,  called in a hired buggy, to take me a drive on the Course. The Course,  as is well known, is the grand resort of the _beau monde_ of Calcutta,  which, like a colony of owls or bats from a ruin, emerge at sundown from  all parts of that extensive city, to see and to be seen, and to enjoy  the coolness of the evening breeze.    Seated in his gig, Marpeet drew up before the barrack in all his glory,  handling the ribbons with the peculiar and finished grace of a man who  had made it his study. Great, indeed, were his pretensions in that way,  and I am confident he would rather have been the leader of the  four-in-hand club, than have written the _Principia_ of Newton.    In I jumped; Marpeet cracked his whip to mettle up his ticca[6] titâan  animal deficient in flesh and blood, certainly, but exhibiting an  amazing deal of bone. Away we went. The evening gun had just boomed; the  myriad crows of the Fort cawed querulously responsive from the trees;  the bugles sounded; the drums beat; the guards at the gates, European  and native, were turned out; captains and lieutenants, flushed with  tiffin or a nap, swords under their arms, sauntered along to join them.  The firefly here and there twinkled in the trees, and the far-off yell  of the jackall proclaimed the approach of night, when away we whirled  through covered ways and over thundering drawbridges, past scarp,  counter-scarp, and glacis, and in a few minutes found ourselves amidst  the throng of carriages and equestrians on the Course, the mass of the  Government-house, with its capacious dome and lion-crowned gates, rising  in front, and the vast semicircle of Chowringhee, with its aggregation  of snow-white structures, stretching away far to the right.    What a singular scene here presented itself to my admiring sight! What  an admixture of nations, and their several modes and peculiaritiesâof  English turn outs and Indian piebald imitationsâwith strange equipages,  combining European finish with the native original! Carriages and  equestrians, walking, trotting, or galloping, passing and repassing!    This is the Hyde Park of the East, where, though less of splendour than  in its great prototype, there was far more variety to be seen. There  came the Governor-General, the viceroy of British India, open barouche  and four (all dignity and gracious bows); cocked hats and feathers  flying; black body-guard before and behind, in a long trot; sabres  flashing, and scabbards rattling. Near, by way of antithesis, might be  seen a palankeen carriage âcreepy crawley,â drawn by two enormous  bullocks, with monstrous dewlaps, bearing some fat old Portuguese lady,  black as Erebus or Nox, to take the air, driver working hard to rouse  them to a transient hobble. There, four or five abreast, rode sundry  dashing young officers, displaying themselves and their uniforms to the  best advantage, âpride in their port, defiance in their eyes;â whilst  near, in some open landau or barouche, the âcynosure of neighbouring  eyes,â would appear the newly-arrived beauty, the belle of the season,  her English roses contrasting with the reigning _pallor_ around, wearing  a look of conscious power, and exhibiting herself to the admiring gaze  of the gossiping world. Happy creature! all is _couleur de rose_ with  you! No thoughts of the future disturb the self-satisfied emotions of  thy exulting bosom! And who is he beside herâthe handsome young  aide-de-camp? With easy bend he leans gracefully towards the carriage,  and checks his fiery Arab. Mark how he rattles, and says his agreeable  things, with all the airs of a conscious âeligible,â whilst the  gratified vanity of the woman sparkles in her eyes and glows in her  animated countenance. Here comes an intruder, bound for a distant  bazaarâjingle, jingle, jingle! What a contrast! a native ruth or bylie,  bullocks in a long trot, a pretty black damsel,                           With rings on her fingers,                         And bells on her toesâ    she of childhoodâs song to a nicetyâpeeping from behind the blinds. âAh!  turn not away those sweet eyes!â Egad, sheâs offâdriver twisting the  tails and goading the quarters of his cattle to âkeep up the steam.â  There whirl past in tilbury or tandem a brace of recently-arrived  writers, regular Meltonians, doing the thing _secundum artem_, and  determined to astonish the crowd. How knowingly, his person  obliqued-quarter front, does the driver sit! With what gentlemanly  _abandon_ does the drivee loll back in the vehicle! These are  high-spirited fellows, who drink their claret, and have never known a  care, and âdâân every thing that is low!â    See, with _andante_ movement now advances the ponderous chariot of the  great Baboo Maha Raja Spooney Persaud Mullik, the great milch-cow of the  lawyers, and who gives his lac at a time from the genuine impulses of a  _native_ benevolence; turbaned coachman; Baboo within, wrapped in  cashmeres, fat, yellow, and bolt upright as the effigy on a tombstone.    Halloo, there! whatâs this? A raceâclear the way! There they come, hired  for the evening, âtwo blind uns and a bolter;â heads down, ears  viciously inclined. âGo it, my middies!â Look at the reefer in  advanceâall aback, toes in his horseâs nose, head on the crupper,  tugging for bare life to make his craft steer or wear. I thought soâsnap  go the tiller-ropesâa man overboardâthe blue-jacket rolls in the dust:  heâs up again, hat rammed over his eyesâbut the bolterâs offâcatch him  who can!    There goes, at a gee-up hobble, a shandry-dan, with two Armenians in  itâhighly respectable men, with queer velvet caps, and very  episcopal-looking apronsâstrange mixture of European and Asiatic,  neither flesh nor fowlâTopee Wala or Puckree Bund.[7] They nod to two  gentlemen passing in a gig, of the gimcrack orderâgentlemen in white  jackets and ditto hats; highly _polished_ men, _i.e._ in the face, which  seems, indeed, to have had the benefit of a bottle of Day and Martinâs  real japan blackingâwho are they? Valiant Lusitanians, illustrious  descendants of Albuquerque and Vasco de GamaâMessrs. Joachim de Reberero  and Gomez de Souza, writers in the office of the salt and opium  department. Who is this in cords, top boots, and white jacketâa dapper,  well-fed little man, on a tall English horse, to which he bears about  the same relative proportions that Falstaffs bread did to his sherris  sack?âAy, who?                   Come, tell it, and burn yeâ                 He isâcan he help it?âa special attorneyâ    an _attachÃ©_ of the Supreme Court.    Such, then, is the Course of Calcutta; and such a little melodramatic  sketch may give some idea of the varied objects which there meet the  eye.    We drove up and down several times, and recognized not a few of our ship  companions; amongst others, the little colonel, in a barouche with some  ladies, whom he was evidently entertaining with a âyarn.â Darkness now  came on apace. The mussalchees, or link boys, with their flaring  mussauls, met their masters at turns of the roads, to light them to  their several homes, and we thought it time to depart. Marpeet drove to  his quarters, where he invited me to pass the evening, to which I  assented. Sitting over our wine, Marpeet discussed the Course, and gave  me a few bits of scandal, touching sundry ladies and gentlemen we had  seen, over which I yawned, for I have ever abominated what are called  private histories.    âWell,â said Marpeet, âI think I shall start for the Upper Provinces,  and leave you sooner than I thought. The lads there in the old corps are  very anxious to have me amongst them once more. I have a letter to-day  from Tippletonâan old friend of mine, who is a real good fellow, with no  nonsense about him (I hope to bring you acquainted some day)âurging my  going up without delay. Let me see,â said he, feeling his pocket, âI  think I have it somewhere about me. Oh, yes, here it is, and you may  read it, if you like. He is rather fond, you will perceive, of the  Hindoostanee zuban, and so forth, but he does not set up for a great  scribe, but is what is better, a devilish honest fellow. Come governor,  toss off your heel-taps, and take some more wine.â    Every language has, probably, terms which, from their superior terseness  or euphony, express more fully the meanings they are intended to convey  than corresponding words in another tongue; and this certainly justifies  their adoption. But there is also a practice of using foreign phrases  indiscriminately, when the native ones would do quite as well. Shortly  after the last peace, novel-writers could express nothing with point and  effect but in French and Italian; so in India there are a class of men,  generally small wits, who interlard their conversation with Hindoostanee  words and phrases; these they often sport in England, where of course  they are unintelligible and out of place. Ye guardian genii! who watch  over the âwell of English undefiled,â whilst you admit what will purify  and sweeten, prevent its unhallowed pollution from garbage thrown into  it by every idle and thoughtless hand! And now for Captain Tippletonâs  letter, which though rather more fully charged with Hindoostanee terms  than any the writer ever met with, yet presents some likeness of a  certain species of Indian epistolary style (of the slip-slop and  slang-wanging order):â                                                       Grillumabad, Aug. 18â      MY DEAR MARPEET,      Just now taking a _dekh_ (look) at the Calcutta _Khubber_ (News), I    saw your name amongst those of a batch of griffs and _Tazu wulaits_    (fresh Europeans), having arrived by the _Rottenbeam Castle_. Welcome    back, my dear fellow, to _John Kumpany ka raj_. I hope you will cut    Calcutta, and lose no time in _puhonchowing_ (conveying) yourself up    by _dawk_ to join the old _pultun_ (battalion), in which, I am sorry    to say, things have been quite _oolta poolta_ (topsy-turvy) since you    left us. Tims has quitted the corps, as you probably know. He was a    dââd _puckha_ (stingy) hand, and a _muggra_ (sulky) beast into the    bargain. However, I donât think we have gained much by his _budlee_    (successor), our new _kummadan_ (commandant)âa regular _bahadur_    (great person), who _dicks_ our lives out with _kuddum ootou_ (drill),    _dumcows_ (bullies) the native officers, and _gallees_ (abuses) the    Jacks (sepoys). Tomkins and I still chum together; he, as _gureeb_ and    _soost_ (quiet and lazy) as ever, and as fond of the _brandy pawney_,    sends his _bhote bhote salaam_ to Marpeet Sahib. Station dullâno    _tumasha_ (fun), as in the old times, when we were first here. The    other day, however, old Dickdar, our brigadier, gave a _burra khanna_    (dinner); his _loll_ (claret) was bang-up and you may be sure we did    not spare the _simpkin_ (champagne); _burra beebee_ (great lady) very    gracious, and a great show-off of the _bal butchos_ (children). We had    the old _bajja_ (band), your creation and hobby, in attendance, and    got up a _nautch_. Smirks, our adjutant, quite a _burra admee_ (great    man) since he mounted the _kantas_ (spurs), bucking up to and devilish    sweet on the spinster; but it wonât _hoga_ (do); nothing under the    revenue or judicial department will go down thereâSamjah Sahib?âYou    understand me. Tip us a _chit_, my dear fellow, by return of _dawk_,    and believe me,                                    My dear Marpeet, ever yours very truly,                                                          JONAS TIPPLETON.    âWell,â said I, âas far as I can understand, it seems a very friendly  sort of a letter; but I should be better able to judge if you would give  me the English of it.â    Marpeet laughed, called me a critical dog, and put the letter in his  pocket.    âCome,â added I, âsince you have shown me your letter, I will read you  mine; one I have received from my factotum, Chattermohun Ghose,  accounting for his temporary absence, which, for the choiceness of its  language, is quite a _bijou_ in its way. Chattermohun tells me he was  for some time a writer in an adjutantâs office, as also in a merchantâs  counting-house here in Calcutta, which doubtless accounts for the  phraseology smacking not a little of the technical language of both  those schools. Here it is:â                       ââMOST RESPECTFUL AND HONOURED SIR,      ââGreatly labouring for fearful apprehension that sudden    non-appearance should dictate condemnation from the sensible benignity    of your excellencyâs reverence, and feeling in concatenation that    explanation was indispensable, I have herewith the honour to inform    you, that one of my family (now consisting of six children effective    of various denominations) was recently solemnized in holy matrimony    and adoptedly conducted according to prescribed rite and custom of    native religion. This solemnization was carried into production my    house in country by Boitacoolah Tâhannah, wither in my patriarchal    duty have repair for a few day.      ââAccording to last order of your reverence, have instruct to Gopee    Nauth, of China Bazaar, to disperse to your quarter goods as per    margin,[8] for which he expect the favour of early remittance. I have    also passed to credit of master account 16 rupees 8 annas, leaving    balance my favour 256 rupees 5 annas 3 pice, as per account enclosed.    Trusting from this statement of explanation your honour not think me    absent without leave, I have honour to be, with deep respect and    consideration,                       ââYour most obedient humble servant,                         ââCHATTERMOHUN GHOSE, _Sircar_.      ââTo his Exc. Ensign Gernon, South Bks.ââ    âWell,â said Marpeet, âthat beats cock-fighting.â                                         CHAPTER X.      Two great sources of attraction to young men existed in Calcutta at the  time of which I am now writing (upwards of twenty-five years ago), and  do still exist, for anything I know to the contrary, Tullohâs and other  auction-rooms, and the China bazaar. At the former almost daily sales  took place of every kind of property from a ship to a penknife, a rabbit  to an elephant; in the latter, all the heterogeneous commodities of an  American store were to be seen mingled pell-mellâraspberry jam, Milroyâs  saddles, best pickles, regulation-swords, wall-shades, China dishes,  hog-spears, Harveyâs sauce, &c.âof which, however, more anon. Catalogues  of the various articles to be disposed of at the dayâs sale at Tullohâs  are (or were) left daily at the houses in or near Calcutta, and made  their appearance, regularly with the newspapers at the break-table,  tempting to extravagance, by stimulating latent desires or creating  fictitious wants.    In our commercial country and its dependencies, where Plutus is the  deity chiefly adored, it seems proper and strictly in character that the  pulpits connected with his worship, however remotely, should be ably and  efficiently filled. Here, in England, we know this to be generally the  case, and what lustre the eloquence of some of our leading auctioneers  has shed on the profession; how truly, indeed, more than one of them  merit the praise which Johnson, happily quoting from Horace, bestowed on  the genius of Goldsmith:ââ_Nihil quod tetigit non ornavit._â    There was no lack of this shining talent, oratorical power, and  technical tact, amongst the auctioneers of Calcutta, seasoned with  humour, pathos, or persuasion, according to the occasion. How often have  I heard the merits of a venerable steed proclaimed; his infirmities and  defects (with a delicate regard to his presence) lightly touched upon,  or at most so disposed, like the shades in a picture, as to heighten and  improve the general effect! How frequently have I been pleasantly  reminded of the good old maxim â_de mortuis nil nisi bonum_,â when  listening to the commendations of a batch of dead and ullaged beer! And  how often tempted to make an investment in a cheap âgross of green  spectacles,â âa lot of damaged huckaback,â or the like, from a strong  impression, fostered by the auctioneers persuasive eloquence, âthat they  might some day come into use,â a contingent probability largely insisted  upon!    What a Herculean task it is to conjure money out of some peopleâs  pockets! Consummate tact is requisite to effect this end. What a world  of machinery must be put in motion before the movable crank, the ownerâs  hand, finds its way into that pecuniary receptacle! A bungler may fumble  for a month and not find the motive spring, whilst an adept will touch  it in a moment. Yes, I see no reason on earth why the auctioneers should  not rank with the liberal professions. Does not the craft combine, in an  eminent degree, many of the leading features of those professions, which  (always considering the predominant turn of the national mind)  unaccountably rank higher in public estimationâthe special pleading of  the lawyer, the eloquence of the senator, and the business-like airs of  the merchant? Does not the auctioneer, like another Charles Martelâay,  and with the same weapon, tooâknock down his lots with as much effect as  the soldier does his? Does he not pronounce orations over the dead, as  has been already shown, and display a beautiful morality in covering, as  with the mantle of charity, a multitude of defects? Is not his âgoing,  going, gone,â too, a brief and pithy sermon, touchingly calculated to  remind us of our common mortality?    And in all these, are not the functions of a higher pulpit strikingly  exercised? Ought he not to be a poet, painter, criticâin short, a man of  taste and general information, or how is he to descant with effect on  the merits of his multifarious wares? Should he not be a phrenologist,  that he may suit his arguments to the several developments of his  bidders; a physiognomist, that he may judge of the effect by the  unerring index of the countenance, whether rallying, bantering,  bullying, or wheedling, is the cue; and a casuist, that he may reconcile  his mind to the various tricks of the trade? and, finally, should he not  have a deep insight into human nature in general, and know well its  various assailable points? âShall I say, 1,000 rupees for you, sir, for  that Arab? no animal can look better, well mounted, I assure you; he  will suit your weight and figure to a nicetyâwas ridden by the Hon.  Capt. Dangle, just gone home, a gentleman very much of your appearance,  sir, and who lately, to borrow the language of our immortal bard, was  wont on our course here âto witch the world with noble horsemanship,â  upon that very Arab. Sirâshall I take your bid?â A complaisant nodâthe  business is done. âThank you, sirâ1,000 rupees for the Arabâgoing,  going, gone!â    One morning, Grundy and I breakfasted together in my room, which was  within a few doors of his own, when one of the afore-mentioned  catalogues found its way into our possession.    âGrundy,â said I, âwhilst I despatch this fish and rice, as you appear  to have done, do just read what there is for sale to-day at the auction.  I have a feeling that I want something, though, hang me if I can exactly  tell what it is.â    Grundy commenced, and read as follows:ââLot 1st. Three fine alderney  cows.â    âDeuce take the cows,â said I; âpush on.â    âThree calves belonging to ditto.â    âFire away.â    âThree Cape sheep, of the Doombah breed.â    âDoombah breed! that sounds well; egad, I think I must have a bid for  the sheepâwhat comes next?â    âA noble French mastiff, two bull-dogs, two wire-haired Scotch terriers,  and a greyhound bitch with pup, just imported by the _Founderwell_.â    âThatâs the ticket,â I exclaimed, with eagerness; âIâll have some of the  dogs, if they go reasonablyâthatâs a settled pointâfor thereâs rare  hunting to be had, I hear, on the way up.â    Grundy ran down several columns more of live and dead stock; and there  were many things, without which I found I could not comfortably exist  for twenty-four hours longer, though, I must confess, I had not thought  of them before.    âBy-the-bye,â drawled Grundy, âtalking of dogs, there was a black fellow  at my door just now with one for sale.â    âWas there?â I eagerly asked; âwhat sort of an animal, and what did the  fellow want for it?â    âWhy,â said my friend, âI think it was a sort of a terrier; but if you  choose, Iâll get my servant to call the man; he canât be very far off.â    âDo,â said I, âsend for him.â    In a few moments, the arrival of the dog and man was duly announced, and  both were admitted to my apartment. The vendor was one of those black,  dirty, low-caste natives, generally attached to European corps, and  denominated âcookboys.â Dressâa soldierâs old castoff coat, a dirty  cloth round his loins, and a skull-cap on his head. As for the dog, he  is not, perhaps, so easily described; he was reddish, stood high on the  legs, and had a wild look; his tail and ears, however, were clipped in a  very _varment_ sort of manner, evincing decided science in the operator;  and his owner assured me, in broken English, that he was âberry high  caste dog,â a thoroughbred terrier; his name Teazer, and a capital  fellow to worry a cat or a jackal.    The creature did not certainly look altogether like the terriers I had  been in the habit of seeing in England; but still, the state of the ears  and tail, the name, and above all, the qualifications, were strong  _primÃ¢ facie_ proofs that he was one. As for the points of difference,  they might, I thought, have resulted from the influence of climate,  which, as it alters the appearance of the European biped very  considerably, might, I very logically inferred, have a similar effect on  the quadrupeds imported, or their descendants, in the first or second  generation at least. In short, I bought him for Rs. 10, and a great  bargain I thought I had; tied him up to the leg of my cot, intending  that he should form the _nucleus_ of a future pack. I was, however,  destined very shortly after to be put a good deal out of conceit of him.    A few days after I had made my purchase, Captain Marpeet dropped in, and  took a seat on my cot as he was wont. Hearing the rattling of a chain  underneath, he said,    âWhat the deuce have you got here, Gernon?â    âA dog,â said I; âa terrier I lately bought.â    âA terrier! eh? Letâs have a look at him.â    Teazer, on being summoned, came out from under the bed, gave himself a  shake, and, on seeing Marpeet, who was strange to him, and rather an  odd-looking fellow to boot, incontinently cocked up his nose and emitted  a most lugubrious howl, one with which the Pariars[9] in India are wont  to serenade âour chaste mistress, the moon.â    âHalloo,â said Marpeet, with a look of surprise, âwhere on earth did you  get this beast? Why, heâs a regular terrier _bunnow_.â[10]    âA terrier _bunnow_,â said I, âwhatâs that?â    âWhy,â rejoined the captain, âheâs a thorough Pariar docked and cropped  to make him look like a terrier; itâs a common trick played upon griffs,  and youâve been taken in, thatâs all. What did you give for him?â    âWhy, ten rupees,â I replied; âand I thought I had him remarkably  cheap.â    âCheap!â said the captain, with infinite contempt; âheâs not worth five  pice; kick him out! hang him!â    âThank you,â said I; âbut as Iâve bought him, Iâll keep him; heâll help  to make up a pack, and I donât see why he should not act up to his  assumed character, and hunt very well; you see he knows how to give  tongue, at all events.â    âHa! ha!â said Marpeet; âcome, thatâs not so bad; but heâs a brute, upon  my lifeâa useless brute, kick him to the dâl.â    âNo,â I rejoined, a little nettled to hear my dog abused after that  fashion; âI tell you Iâll keep him; besides, I have no acquaintance in  the quarter you mention, and should be sorry to send him where he would  be likely to annoy you again.â    Here were symptoms of downright insubordination. The captain stared at  me in astonishment, and emitted a long and elaborate âwhew!â    ââPon my honour, regular disrespect to your superior officer. Well,  after that, I must have a glass of brandy-pawny.â    âSo you shall,â said I, âwith all my heart; but you really were a little  too hard, and forgot the saying, âLove me, love my dog.ââ    To return, however, from this little episode. Grundy and I, in pursuance  of our determination to visit the auction, got into our palankeens, and  soon found ourselves amidst the dust, noise, and motion of Tank Square,  near which the auction, or outcry (as it is more usually termed in  India) is held. A long covered place, something like a repository,  filled with palankeens, carriages, horses, &c., for sale, had to be  passed through before we reached the auction-room, where goods of all  kinds were disposed of. This we found crammed with natives, low  Europeans, black Portuguese, and others of the motley population of  Calcutta, mingled with a few civilians, and a âpretty considerableâ  sprinkling of redcoats from Barrackpore or the fort, all more or less  intent upon the bidding.    The auctioneer, a good-looking man and remarkably fluent, was mounted on  his rostrum, and holding forth upon the merits of certain goods, which a  native assistant, on a platform a little lower than the pulpit, was  handing round for inspection. Grundy and I forced our way in, watching  anxiously to see if any thing âin our wayâ was exhibiting. At last, the  auctioneer took up a goodly-sized knife, with some dozen blades, &c.  These he opened daintily and deliberately, and then, holding up the  knife and turning it about, he said,    âNow hereâs a pretty thingâa highly-finished articleâa perfect _multum  in parvo_. Donât all of you bid for this at once, gentlemen, if you  please. Hereâs a large blade, you see, to cut bread and cheese with, a  small one to mend your pens, a corkscrew to open a bottle of Hodgsonâs  pale ale when you are out shooting, tweezers to pull the thorns out of  your toes, pincers, file, gimletâall complete. A most useful article  that, and (with marked emphasis, and an eye towards Grundy and me, which  made us exchange looks significant of purchase), one which no young  sportsman should be without.â    That was sufficient; I was determined to have it, and after an eager bid  or two, it was knocked down to me. I found afterwards, however, to my  extreme surprise and dismay, I had unconsciously purchased a lot of  three dozen of them, enough to set up a cutlerâs stall in a small way.  There was no help for it, however; I was obliged to take them all,  though I determined in future to study well the catalogue before I  ventured on a bid.    The dogs, I found, had attracted the particular notice of more sportsmen  than myself. A young ensign from Barrackpore carried off the greyhound  hitch for Rs. 200, a little more than a monthâs pay. A writer in the  buildings bought the French mastiff and the terrier, which went high,  and I was obliged to content myself with one of the bull-dogs, a  sinister-looking old fellow, with one eye, who went cheap, and would  have been cheaper still, had not Grundy, whom I requested to secure it,  bidden silently against me in the crowd several times before I had  providentially discovered my opponent. Poor beast! he died three months  after, on my way up, of _nostalgia_, I rather think, and I gave him  decent sepulture on a spit of sand in the Ganges.    From the auction we proceeded to the China bazaar.    âGrundy,â said I, as we went along, rather _nonchalamment_, âyou need  not say anything to Captain Marpeet, about my buying those knives.â    âWhat knives?â he asked.    âI have my reasons for it,â said I, âthatâs enough.â    Grundy promised to be mum.    The China bazaar! What Bengalee, military man in particular, who does  not know that attractive resortâthat repository of temptations! What a  host of pleasant recollections it is calculated to revive!    This place is situated at the back of Tank Square, and is enclosed by  walls, and entered by gates, at several points. The shops are in long  flat-roofed ranges, generally of (I believe) two stories, intersecting  each other at right angles; a margin of terrace, a foot or two from the  ground, runs along the front of the several shops or stores. Sheltered  here and there by an eave or thatched projection, seated in chairs,  cross-legged, and in other un-English attitudes, quite at their ease,  and smoking their pipes, the baboos, or shopkeepers, may be seen, each  opposite his emporium, into which they invite the numerous visitors to  the bazaar to enter, assuring them they will find everything they may  want âchip,â and of the first quality.    As Grundy and I sauntered down one of the streets, we were struck by the  appearance of one of the native shopkeepers, who, with an air of  courtier-like urbanity, invited us to enter his store. In stature, he  was about six feet three or four, stout in proportion; a muslin chudder  or toga was thrown over his shoulders, and a piece more round his waist,  but slightly concealing his brawny form; altogether he was the  finest-looking Bengalee I ever beheld; indeed, I thought it a pity such  thews and sinews, so well calculated for the tug of war, should be lost  in the inglorious inaction of the China bazaar. This worthy I afterwards  learnt was that celebrated character âJawing Jack,â well known amongst  cadets for his _copia verborum_ and dignified address. Nature and  destiny had evidently been at cross-purposes in the management of Jack;  the former had clearly intended him morally for what he was physically,  a great man, but his stars had thwarted the design.    Jack rose from his chair as we drew near, overshadowing us striplings  with his Patagonian bulk. I, for my part (being then what is vulgarly  called a âlathy chapâ), felt myself disagreeably _small_ beside him,  doubly so he being a âblack fellow,â and thought I was under the  necessity of speaking pretty big, in order to make up for the  deficiency, and to place myself more on a level with him. âJawing Jackâ  had had large experience of griffs, and, though he treated us in a kind  of patronising manner, he cautiously avoided anything that might lead to  offence, and a consequent lowering of his own dignity.    There is a sly satire sometimes in the calm and imperturbable deportment  of the Asiatic, when dealing with the rattling, blustering, overbearing  European, which conveys a tacit censure well calculated to shame our  boasted civilization. âLately arrived from Europe, gentlemen, I suppose?  Hope you are quite well? Will you please do me the honour to walk into  my shopâshall be happy to supply anything re-qui-red, at very reasonable  price. I have honour to be well known to all military gentlemen at  Barrackpore, and sell best of European articles, and no âNiverpool[11]  goods.ââ Having rummaged âJawing Jackâsâ shop, and bought a few  articles, we took our departure, promising at parting to honour him with  our future custom.    The Bengalese have a wonderful deal of versatility and acuteness,  certainly not naturally the mental power and energy of the European; but  as they live temperately, and do not clog the intellectual wheels with  beef and malt liquor, the mental machinery is generally in capital  working order.    On returning to my quarters, I found a chupprassy, or messenger, with a  note from General Capsicum, acknowledging the receipt of a letter I had  sent him from his friend Sir Toby Tickle, and requesting my company to  tiffin and dinner on the following day, at his house at Garden Reach.    A little before the appointed hour, I ordered a palankeen, and proceeded  to the generalâs residence, situated in a pleasant domain, some two or  three miles from Calcutta. On arriving, I was shown up-stairs into the  drawing room, which commanded a pleasant view of the Hoogly, with its  moving scene of boats and shipping, and a distant peep of Fort William.    I was standing gazing on the prospect, admiring the boats under sail  gliding from side to side, walking as it were the minuet of the waters,  the shadows skimming over the river, and the milk-white villas on the  opposite bank starting out from amidst the bright green of surrounding  groves, when the rustle of a gown and a slight touch on the shoulder  aroused me from my state of abstraction. It was the young widow of whom  I have already made mention, âthe softened imageâ of the rough old  general, my Hibernian host.    âHow do you do, Mr. Gernon?â said she, extending her hand with exceeding  frankness and smiling cordiality; âI am so glad to see you again and not  looking in any way the worse for your sojourn in Calcutta.â (Oh! that  our English pride and sensitiveness, those adamantine trammels of caste,  which strangle so many of our virtues, would let us have a little more  of that single-hearted openness âwhich thinketh no evilââit is so  comfortable!) âHave you seen my father yet?â asked Mrs. Delaval, for  that was her name.    I answered in the negative.    âOh, then,â she continued, âhe will be here immediately when he knows of  your arrival, for he is anxious, I know, to see you; he is somewhere in  the house, amusing himself with his violin. But pray, Mr. Gernon, be  seated,â she continued, âand tell me how you like India, now that you  have seen a little more of it.â    âI like it much,â I replied, âand never was happier in my life. I have  got my commission, and as soon as posted to a regiment, am off to the  Upper Provinces by water. I have some idea of applying for a particular  corps, but have not yet decided on that point: they say you should not  interfere with the operations of the Fates, but leave yourself to their  direction. What, madam,â continued I, âwould you advise me to do?â    âOh! really,â said Mrs. Delaval, smiling at the idea of my asking her  advice on such a point, âI fear I am incompetent to advise you, not  knowing all the circumstances of your position; you ought, of course, to  consider well before you act, and having so done, leave the result to  Providence. I am, however,â said she, somewhat seriously, âa decided  predestinarian, and believe that                  âThere is a providence that shapes our ends,                Rough-hew them how we will.ââ    âIt is a puzzling subject,â said I, âand one that is rather beyond me;  one if I remember rightly, that even bewildered the devils in  Pandemonium. However, I think the safest maxim to hold by is, that  âconduct is fate.ââ    This was rather a philosophical opinion for a griffin, but one which I  have always held, though young blood at that time and since has often  capsized the philosopher.    âWell, Mr. Gernon,â continued she, âyou have my best wishes for your  happiness and success in life; all is _couleur de rose_ with you now;  may it ever so continue! Already,â said she, and the tear glistened,  âthe clouds of life are beginning to pass over me.â    As she said this, she crossed her fair white hands on her lap, and the  widowâs eyes sadly dropped on her wedding ring, the little golden  circlet type of eternal fidelity. I understood it, and was silent.  Silence is preferable on such occasions, perhaps, to the commonplaces of  condolence. We both continued mute for some moments; she looking at her  ring, I out of the window.    At length, I ventured to say,    âDear madam, do not deem me impertinent, I pray; but cheer up; remember,  as my Irish half-countryman beautifully expresses it, âevery dark cloud  has a silver lining,â and there are doubtless many, many happy days yet  in store for you.â    I should have premised, that Mrs. Delaval had lately lost her husband, a  fine young fellow, who fell in the storm of a small Polygar fort on the  coast, and Time had not yet brought that balm with which in due course  he heals the wounds of the heart, unless the very deepest. I was  certainly waxing tender, when the idea of Olivia, my poor abandoned  Olivia, crossed my mind. âWhat would Mrs. Grundy say,â thought I, âif  she knew of it?â    The widow gave her auburn locks a toss, made an effort at  self-possession, smiled through her tears, and was herself again.    âBy-the-bye, Mr. Gernon,â said she, âthough but a recent acquaintance, I  will assume the privilege of an old friend, and give you some little  information whilst we are alone, which may be of some advantage to you  in your intercourse with this family.â    I looked alarmed, not knowing what was forthcoming. She perceived what  was passing in my mind.    âYou need not think, Mr. Gernon,â and she smiled, âthat you have come  amongst giants or ogres, who are likely to form designs against your  life and liberty. Nothing quite so bad as thatâno. What I wished to say  is, that my father is a man of warm and generous impulses, but violently  passionate and eccentric; and I entreat you to be cautious in what you  say before him, and do not press any subject if you find him evincing  impatience. If he likes he may serve you; but if he takes a prejudice,  he is exceedingly persecuting and bitter: a warm friend but an  inexorable foe. Mrs. Capsicum, to much vulgarity adds all my fatherâs  violence and irritability, with none of his redeeming qualities. You  must be submissive, and prove yourself a âgood listener,â or you will  have little chance of standing well with her.â    This was said with some little asperity of manner, plainly indicating  that the step-mother was not more popular than step-mothers generally  are.    âAs for the others you will see here, you may safely be left to the  guidance of your own judgment and discretion in your conduct towards  them.â    I thanked Mrs. Delaval for her information, which, I saw, emanated from  the purest feeling of womanly kindness, and promised to be on my guard,  and endeavour to profit by it.                                        CHAPTER XI.      I must here interrupt the thread of my narrative, in order to give a few  particulars respecting my host and his family, which may serve as  samples of the olden time of India.    The general was the youngest of the ten sons of Sir Gerald Capsicum, a  fire-eating baronet of a ârare ould ancient Irish family,â and was sent  to India about anno 1750, with little more than his sword, his brogue,  and the family love of fighting wherewith to assist him on in the world.  The generalâs career had been varied, and he had gone through all the  adventures, public and domestic, which usually happened to those whose  lot, in respect to time and place, had been similarly cast.    I have said the general was an Irishman; it follows as a natural  consequence, that he was extremely susceptible of the tenderest of  passions; and as in his early days there were few white dames in the  land, like many others he eâen put up with a black oneâattached himself  to Sung Sittara Begum (the âQueen of Starsâ), one of the gazelle-eyed  daughters of Hind.    This union, though not cemented by the forms of marriage, was, on the  whole, more harmonious and enduring than many that are. I say on the  whole; for if tradition may be depended on, the Queen of Stars was wont,  now and then, to exhibit traits of vivacity, which were rather of a  _striking_ than of a pleasing nature. With these trifling breaks, the  union long harmoniously subsisted, and was not finally dissolved till  the angel of death, one fine day, summoned the Begum to the seventh  heaven.    By the Begum, the general had Major John Capsicum, an officer in the  service, and commanding the forces of his highness Ram Row Bhow Punt,  the Jam of Ghurrumnugger, a Mahratta potentate of small note, whose  territories it might be difficult to discover in the map; secondly,  Augustus, an indigo planter in the district of Jessore, commonly called  by the generalâs native servants (who, like all the rest of the  fraternity, were not _au fait_ at European names) âDisgustus Sahib;â and  Mrs. Colonel Yellowly, a lady of high and indomitable spirit, who died  some years before the period to which I am referring, and of whom I  could learn little more from record or tradition than that she was  rather celebrated for the manufacture of Chutnee and Dopiajah curry,  talked a good deal of a certain _terra incognita_ called âhome,â and  ultimately went off rather suddenly,âas some affirm, from chagrin in  consequence of having a point of precedence decided against her, arising  out of a dispute with Lady Jiggs at a presidency party as to who _de  jure_ should first come in or go out.    The stickling for precedency, by the way, is a disorder very prevalent  in colonial dependencies; and like gravitation, which increases with the  squares of the distance, its intensity seems to be governed by a  somewhat similar law, and to exist in an inverse ratio to the apparent  cause for it.    Long after the general had passed his fiftieth year, he married the  mother of the amiable widow (a nonpareil grafted on a crab), by all  accounts a charming person, who, yielding to importunity, took old  Capsicum to gratify the ambition of worldly parents, in whose opinion  wealth and rank are all that are essential to connubial happiness.    Poor thing! she gave her hand, but her heart was anotherâs. The  worm-iâ-the-bud was there, and soon did the business. Opportunity  offeredânature was too powerful for the colder suggestions of dutyâshe  eloped with the man she loved; but even love cannot flourish in an  atmosphere of scorn. Mankind are intensely gregarious. Shunnedâdeserted  by her own sex, who, like birds (though from more obvious cause), peck  their wounded fellows to deathâshe died in a lone outpost, and the winds  of the jungles pipe over her solitary grave.               âCâest bien difficile dâÃªtre fidÃ¨le             A de certains maris, faits dâan certain modelle,             Et qui donne Ã  sa fille un homme quâelle haÃ¯t.             Est responsable au Ciel pour le mal quâelle fait.â    Admirable MoliÃ¨re! you never penned a more striking truth. Parents,  ponder it well.    The general, after the lapse of some years, with the characteristic  valour of the Capsicums, boldly ventured, a short time before I knew  him, on a second marriage; but here he caught a Tartar. Mrs. Capsicum  the second was an Irish lady (woman I should perhaps say), who came  out to India avowedly on spec., with the full determination of  marrying a good establishment, with comfortable reversionary  prospects, however they might happen to be encumbered. She made play  at the general, sang âErin mavourneenâ and âCathleen OâMore,â talked  of the Callaghans and Brallaghans, revived the generalâs boyish  reminiscences of the green hills of Sligo, and ultimately led him, or  rather had him carried, to the hymeneal altar! Of loveâthe proper  cement of the marriage-unionâthere was none, on her side at least.    But to return to my narrative.    The widow and I had not been long engaged in conversation (which, as I  before hinted, was becoming rather interesting), when we heard the  scrape of a violin outside in the passage.    âOh, here is my father,â said Mrs. Delaval, âcoming from his room. Now  remember my caution.â    I was about to reply, but she laid her finger on her lip expressively,  as much as to say, âAnother time; heâs here.â    The old general now entered, with a black velvet sort of nightcap stuck  rakishly on his head, and playing rather jauntily âSt. Patrickâs Day in  the Morning,â to which he hummed an accompanimentâhis voice displaying,  as usual, all that vigour in its tones which, as I have before remarked,  afforded so striking a contrast to his dried-up and time-worn frame: as  he entered with his spindle shanks, huge frill, voluminous upper works,  pigtail, and velvet cap, I thought I never saw a droller figure. Still  the gallant bearing and nonchalance of the little old Irishman, who  evidently was unconscious of anything at all out of the way in himself,  rather neutralized any feeling of disrespect which his figure was at  first calculated to excite.    On seeing me, he finished off the saint with a few galloping flourishes,  pushed the fiddle on the table; transferred the stick to his left hand,  and made a rapid advance, or rather toddle, towards me, with his right  extended.    âHah, sur, Iâm glad to see you,â said he; âMr. Gernon, I believe? Very  happy indeed to have your company, sur; shall be glad to show you ivery  attintion in ivery sense of the word, sur, for the sake of my old friend  Sir Toby; and I doubt not,â he continued, with a low bow of the old  school and a smile, âthat I shall be able also to add, on your own.â    As he made this courteous speech and inclination, his eye lighted on a  letter lying on the table, which quickly threw the irritable old fellow  off his balance, and put the courtier to flight.    âWhy,ââmee heart, Cordalia,â he thundered out in a voice that startled  me; âby all thatâs good, that egragious ass, Ramdial, has gone without  the letter. A man naid have the timper of an angel to dale with these  fellows.â    Mrs. Delaval, to cut the affair short, rose immediately from her seat,  and taking the letter, called a servant to the head of the stairs, and  quickly rectified the omission.    âThank ye, Cordalia, mee love,â said the old general as she returned;  âthank ye, mee darling;â and taking her hand and drawing the graceful  creature towards him, he imprinted a kiss on her cheek.    Thereâs no use mincing mattersâI certainly envied him the privilege.    This little interruption over, I returned to a speech which, having  previously worded and fashioned in rather a superior style, I thought it  a pity should be lost.    I said, after a hem or two, that I felt deeply obliged for his cordial  reception of me, that I should study to deserve his good opinion, and to  realize the gratifying anticipations he had so obligingly expressed, &c.  &c.    âYe will, sur; ye will, sur,â said the general; âIâve not the laste  doubt of it; and, plase God, weâll some day see you as accomplished a  soldier as was your poor uncle, the colonel.â    âWhat! sir,â said I, pleased with the discovery, and with no fear that  _he_ was about to come Chattermohun over me; âdid you then know my  uncle, Colonel Gernon?â    âKnow him!â said the general, with energy and warmthââI did, and right  well too; we were in Goddardâs march together and the Rohilla campaign,  and in many places besides. Yes,â he continued, warming as he went on,  âpoor Pat Gernon and I have broiled under the same tint and fought under  the same banner, ay, by Gââ, and mounted the same brache together; yes,â  added he, clutching his fiddlestick, and looking as fierce as if he was  bursting through the fire and carnage of an assault, âI think I now hear  the shouts of the inimy, and see your brave uncle lading on his gallant  Sapoys through fire and smoke, his beaver in one hand and his sword in  the other. Ah,â he went on, touched and overcome, whilst his eye  moistened, âthem were the days: the thought of themâit is now long, long  backâand of all my old companions gone, comes over me sometimes like a  faint air or a summerâs drame. Know your uncle! Ay did I, and a braver  soldier or a better man (though he had his faults, and who the divil has  not?) never broke the bread of life.â    I felt a sensation of choking, whilst all the ancient blood of the  Gernons mantled in my cheeks, as I listened to the veteranâs animated  laudation of my deceased relative.    âWell, sur,â continued the general, suddenly changing the subject, and  as if a little ashamed of the weakness and enthusiasm into which he had  been betrayed, âand how did you lave my old friend, Sir Toby? Is he as  fond of his bottle and his rubber as he used to be? I think he played  the best hand at whist of any man I ever knew.â    âI believe, sir,â said I, âthat Sir Tobyâs habits are unchanged in those  respects; though I am unable to speak much of him from personal  knowledge, having obtained the letter of introduction which I have had  the honour to deliver to you through the kindness of a mutual friend.â    âWell, never mind how ye got it, so that ye did get it. I am extramely  happy that it has been the manes of introducing to my acquaintance the  nephew of my old companion in arms, to whom, by the way, you bear a  strong resemblance: so now,â he continued, âtalk to my daughter, or  amuse yourself in any way ye plase till tiffin, and Iâll do the same;  this is liberty hall, where every man does as he plases. Cordalia, my  love, where is your mother?â    âI have not seen Mrs. Capsicum, sir, this morning since breakfast,â  replied Mrs. Delaval; âbut I believe she has gone out to pay some  visits.â    âHas she?â said the general dryly; âwell, now, I thought I noticed a  remarkable stillness over the house.â    This was said in a manner, I thought, which smacked of what may be  termed a bitter mirth.    This conversation had scarcely terminated, when we heard a loud and  angry voice on the stairs or landing; and next moment, in sailed Mrs.  Capsicum Secunda, with a face that would have made a fine study for a  Hecate, a Gorgon, a Fury, or any other of those celebrated characters,  in whose countenances the ancients were wont to depict all the wildest  play of the passions. Mrs. Delaval turned pale, the old general looked  dismayed, and I, for my part, groped for my hat, thinking I might  doubtless be _de trop_ and better out of the way before the family  breeze sprung up, and of which there were such alarming indications.    Mrs. Capsicum seated herself majesticallyâher lip quivered with rage,  and an unhappy poodle, who came to be caressed, and received a sweeping  blow from her foot, which caused him to throw a ludicrous somerset. Now,  thought I, âlook out for squalls.â    General Capsicum knew, probably from experience, that his spouse would  generally have the last word, but on the present occasion he was  determined (or deemed it politic) to have the first.    âMrs. Capsicum, mee dear,â said he, in a deprecating tone, âyou donât  appear to persave our young friend here, Mr. Gernonâ (wishing clearly to  throw me out as a tub to the whale). The lady measured me with a  momentary glance, and made the stiffest conceivable inclination,  accompanied by a look of the concentrated essence of vinegar and  brimstone; it was positively annihilating.    After certain premonitory symptoms of Mrs. Capsicumâs passion, out it  came:â    âGinrel Capsicum,â said she, âaither I lave your house, or that rascal  Khoda Buccas, coachmaun, laves your service.â    She then proceeded to detail some neglect of which the unfortunate Jehu  had been guilty. The general tried to mollify her, but without success,  and Khoda Buccas was summoned to the âpresenceâ to answer for his  misdeeds: in he came, with a low salaam, and trembling from head to  foot.    The general was about to open the charges when Khoda Buccas, who knew  all about it beforehand, broke in upon him, and, with the full energy of  alarm and great volubility, entered clamorously on his defence.    â_Mera kooch kussor nuheen Kodabund_ (No fault of mine, servant of the  Lord, and protector of the poor), but _Bijlee Goorah_ (the horse  Lightning), was sick (_sick maun Hogeya_),[12] and then the roan had  lost her hind shoes, _Gureebpurwar_. Here and there, all over the  bazaar, your slave hunted for the blacksmith, and could not find him. At  last your slave found him, and said, âCome quick and shoe _Summon  Goorah_ (the roan horse), for the lady will want the carriage, and her  disposition is a little warm (_misaj tora gurrum_), and your slave will  be beat and get into trouble;â and so he said to me âBrother,â said he,  &c., &c., and so I was late.â    This and a good deal more, as explained to me by Mrs. Delaval, was the  rambling defence of Khoda Buccas, coachmaun. The old gentleman seemed  disposed to admit its sufficiency; but madame peremptorily ordered off  the unhappy charioteer, with the comfortable assurance that he should be  flogged and dismissed.    Oh, tyranny, thou propensity of ungenerous souls! like Othelloâs love,  thou growest with indulgence; till, like to every other evil, thou at  last evokest the spirit that lays thee low!    Well, the storm at last having fairly subsided, the general hobbled to  the couch, and took up a paper, as if glad for a season to retreat  within himself. Mrs. Delaval and I carried on a conversation in an  under-tone, whilst Mrs. Capsicum in silence digested her choler.    The silence was interrupted by the entrance of a native servant, who,  with closed hands, and in a manner profoundly respectful, said something  in an under-tone to the beebee sahib.    âGinrel Capsicum,â said Mrs. C., as the servant withdrew, âhere is your  son Augustus arrived.â    âIs he?â said the old general, jumping up and throwing down the paper;  âfaith, then, Iâm glad of it, and ye havenât told me a pleasanter thing  for a long time, my deer.â    These words were scarcely uttered, when a dark black-whiskered man, of a  frank and ingenuous countenance, with a hunting-cap on his head, and a  whip in his hand, entered the room, and running up to the old general  and seizing his extended hand in both his own, in a manner which bespoke  genuine warmth and affection, exclaimed:    âHow are you, sir? quite recovered, I hope, from your last attack?â    âWell, my boy, well!â said the general, his eyes sparkling with pleasure  as he measured his stalwart dark offspring from head to foot, as if in  some doubt as to whether he could really be the sire of such a brawny  chiel. âWell! and right glad to see you here; how did you come?â    âWhy, I left the factory early this morning, sir,â said âDisgustus;â  âcame on as far as the Budlampore ghaut in the pinnace; from that I  drove the buggy down to the Thannah, and there I found Golaub in  waiting; I rode him in here at a rattling paceâconfounded hot work it  was, though; and I expect Iâve rather taken the shine out of the Arab.â    âThatâs well,â said the general, âand now be sated. Augustus, my young  friend, Mr. Gernon; Mr. Gernon, my son, Mr. Augustus Capsicum.â    I bowed with English formality, but the hearty man of blue did not  appear to understand that sort of thing, but came up and shook me by the  hand; asked me if I was lately arrived, and said he was glad to see me.  This was a pleasing trait, and showed me the frankness of his  disposition.    After some little conversation with his mother-in-law, with whom it was  easy to perceive he was no particular favourite, and a lively chat with  his lovely and generous-minded sister, who it was equally obvious loved  her dark brother, in spite of the bend sinister in his escutcheon,[13]  General Capsicum again addressed his son:    âWell, Augustus,â said he, âwhat are the prospects of indigo this year?  how does the blue look?â    âOh! fair, sir, very fair. If we have no further rise of the river, and  get a few light showers, and the rain does not fall too long to wash the  colour out of the plant, and this wind continues, we shall do very well  this year. The price is well up, Rs. 300 a maund for the best, and I  think we shall make 600. The plant looks beautiful on the Chuckergolly  chursâat least it did till the Bobberygunge Talookdarâs cows and  buffaloes got into it. However, after all, I think we shall, on the  whole, have a capital season.â    âThatâs well,â said the general. âEgad, I think weâll see you go home  with your plum, Augustus, yet.â    âHome, sir!â said Augustus; âI know of no home but India. Here I was  born, and here, please God, I will die, however singular the  determination.â    Tiffin was now announced, and we descended to the dining-room. Tiffin,  or lunch, is in Bengal a delightful meal, suitable in its character to  the climate, which renders the supererogatory one of dinner,  particularly in the hot season, with its hecatombs of smoking meat and  general superfluity of viands, often very much the reverse.    The tiffin on the whole passed off very agreeably. Mrs. Delaval  described society as it exists in the Madras presidency, and much she  had seen and heard there. Augustus told us of a recent battle-royal, a  sort of Bengalee Chevy Chase, which had been fought between his  followers and those of a neighbouring Zumeendar, by way of settling the  right to some disputed beegahs of indigo; in which many crowns were  cracked, and astonishing feats of chivalry displayed on both sides.    But the parts of his conversation which most delighted me, were the  accounts he gave of sundry wild hog and buffalo hunts, which after  deducting about 50 per cent. on account of embellishmentsâfor sportsmen,  like poets, must be allowed some considerable latitude in that wayâwere  really very exciting. In fact, I told him I was dying to have a touch at  the hogs and buffaloes myself, and that I hoped it would not be long  before I fleshed my maiden spear on a few of the former.    This looked rather like a fish for an invitation to the Junglesoor  Factory, and I wonât swear that I was wholly without design on the  worthy indigo planterâs hospitality in making the remark; whether he,  viewed it in this light, or not, I cannot say, but he promptly said he  should be happy to gratify my longing in that line, if I would go and  spend a fortnight with him at his factory.    I replied, âI should be delighted to accompany him, if I could obtain  leave.â    âOh!â said he, âthat difficulty can easily be overcome; my father, I  dare say, will give you a note to a friend of his in the  adjutant-generalâs office, whoâll procure you leave at once.â    âI shall have a grate dale of pleasure in so doing,â said the general;  âbut Augustus, now, I entrate you, lade the young man into no scrapes:  and donât let us hear of his being gored by a buffalo, or ate up by a  tiger, or killed by some of them brutes of horses of yours.â    âOh! no,â said Augustus, laughing and winking at me; âwell take care of  all that, sir.â                                        CHAPTER XII.      My last chapter left us seated around the social board at Tiffin. A  little incident occurred during this meal, which for a moment disturbed  the harmony of the party, and, whilst strongly elucidating the character  given by Mrs. Delaval of her father, showed that her caution to me, to  be on my guard with the atrabilious old hero, was not bestowed without  reason. The generalâs temper truly was like a pistol with a hair-trigger  (as I had afterwards further occasion to observe), going off at the  slightest touch, and requiring infinite caution in the handling.    Like many old Indians of that day, and I may add, most old gentlemen,  the general piqued himself on the quality of his wines. He had a history  for every batch; generally ramifying into almost interminable anecdotes  of the Dicks and Bobs, defunct _bon vivans_ of other days, who in the  course of half a century had partaken of his hospitality.    âWhat do you think of that claret, Mr. Gernon?â asked the old general,  after I had duly engulphed a _bonum magnum_ of it. âIâll engage you find  that good.â    Now I must confess that, up to that period (sundry glasses of ginger and  gooseberry inclusive), the aggregate quantity of vinous fluid consumed  by me, and constituting the basis of my experience, could not have  exceeded two or three dozen at the most. But I was flattered by the  generalâs appeal, and, as a military man, I felt that I ought not to  appear ignorant and inexperienced on such a matter.    Many young Oxonians and Cantabs, whom I had known at home, little my  seniors, had talked flingingly in my presence of âtheir wine,â and the  quantity consumed by the âmenâ of their respective colleges; and why  should not I, methought, assume the air of the â_savoir vivre_,â and  appear at home in these things, who have already figured in print and  buckled cold steel on my thigh? I had heard much, too, of light wines,  and dry wines, wines that were full and strong-bodied, &c., and, though  I attached no very clear and definite ideas to these terms, I had still  a hazy conception of their meaning, and was determined, at all events,  to sport one or two of them on the present occasion.    In reply to the generalâs question, I filled a glass, and after taking  an observation of the sun through it (just then darting his evening rays  through the venetians) with my right eye, accompanied by a scientific  screw of the facial muscles, pronounced it, with a smack, to be a fine  full-bodied wine, adding, unhappily, that âI should have almost taken it  for port.â    The general laid down his knife and fork. âPort! Why, sir, sure ye never  drank a drop of good claret in your life, if you say so.â    âI beg pardon, sir!â said I (I saw I was getting into a scrape), âbut I  may perhaps be wrong in saying it resembles port. I meant to sayâto  implyâthat isâthat it is very strong claret.â    âPooh, nonsense,â said the general pettishly, on whom my explanation was  far from producing the desired effect. âYe can know nothing about  claretâ (he was not very wide of the mark there). âStrong! like port,  indeed!!â    âMy dear father,â said Mrs. Delaval (the women are ever our good  geniuses on these occasions), who marked, I have no doubt, the clouds  gathering on my brow, ânever mind; what does it signify? You know,â said  she, laying her hand on the generalâs shoulder, and looking at him with  a sweet and beseeching expression, âyou know, Mr. Gernon is quite young,  and cannot have had much experience in wines.â    âThen let him take my advice, Cordalia, and not talk about what he does  not understand. Strong! ha! ha! Port, indeed!â    I was thunderstruck, and thought verily I should have launched the  bottle at the head of the testy old veteran, so deep a wound had my  pride received. I could hardly believe it possible that one of evidently  so fine a character in the main, could give way to such unbecoming  conduct on so trifling a matter.    The fact is, the general had had his crosses and trials, and such often  shatter the temper irretrievably, though the heart and principles may  remain soundâmuch charity and discrimination are requisite to enable us  to form a just judgment of others, to decide on the predominant hue of  that mingled skein which constitutes individual character.    Augustus, worthy fellow that he was, saw my distress and redoubled his  civility, whilst Mrs. Delaval, by that tact and kindness which women  best know how to exhibit on such occasions, endeavoured to soften my  sense of the indignity; even Mrs. Capsicum took up the cudgels in my  behalf, and told the general roundly that he made himself quite  ridiculous about his wine. But all would not do; the affront was too  recent, and I was moody and glum, pondering within myself as to whether  there were any well-established precedents on record, of ensigns of  seventeen calling out and shooting generals of eighty.    General Capsicumâs irritability, however, soon subsided, and  compunctious visitings arose; I could see this by his eye and the  softened expression of his countenance, and that he was moreover anxious  to make the _amende honorable_; at last he reached the bottle and filled  himself a bumper and me another.    âCome,â said he, good-humouredly, âlet us try another glass, and dâân  the port. Hereâs your very good health, and success to your first dayâs  hog-hunting with Augustus.â    I returned the salutation rather stiffly, for, though of a placable  nature, I had not digested the affront; however, the tide of my anger  was turned, and by dinnertime the general and I were as good friends as  if nothing had happened.    We lingered for an hour or two at the tiffin table, Augustus Sahib  entertaining me with some details of snipe-shooting, and arranging a  programme of our future sporting operations, the general drowsily  smoking his hookah and nodding in his chair, with an occasional start  and muttered commentary on our conversation, indicative, I once or twice  thought, of some fresh explosion.    At length, on the approach of evening, the servants, as is usual in  India, unbolted and threw open the long venetian doors, to admit the  cool air, and out we sauntered on the lawn, to join the ladies (to whose  number some addition had been made), and who had preceded us, and were  admiring the moving scene on the river.    The sun had just gone down, and all nature seemed to be with one accord  putting forth a rejoicing shout, an excess of that luminary producing  all the torpid effects which arise from a deficiency of his beams  elsewhere. The kite whistled querulously from the house-top, the maynas  and squirrels chattered joyfully in the trees, ring-doves cooed, and the  bright yellow mango birds and the dark coel (loved of Indian maids) shot  through the cool groves and glades of cocoa-nut and bananas (plantains),  uttering their clear and shrilly notes.    Mr. Augustus joined the stately Mrs. Capsicum and the newly-arrived  spinster, whilst I paired off with the widow, towards whom I felt myself  drawn by an irresistible power of attraction. I felt great delight  certainly in the society and conversation of this lady; though then too  young to analyze the sources of my admiration, reflection has since  shown me what they were, having passed them through the prism of my  mind, and separated those pencils of moral light which, united, produced  the sum of her excellence. I cannot here resist drawing a little  portrait of her.    To a full, yet graceful, person Mrs. Delaval united a countenance,  which, if not regularly beautiful, still beamed with goodness and  intelligenceâsensible, lively, yet modest and discreet, she was all that  man should desire, and woman wish to be. Above the common littlenesses  of the world, her heart was deeply fraught with feeling and  sensibilityâthough, unlike her sex in general, she could direct and  restrain them both by the powers of a clear and masculine understanding.  Her Irish paternity had given her impulses; her Saxon blood had  furnished their regulating power. She played, sang, drew, and, in a  word, was mistress of all those lighter accomplishments which serve to  attract lovers, but which alone rarely suffice to keep them; to these  she added a mind of an original turn, improved by reading and  reflection. Much good advice did she impart, the nature of which the  reader may readily imagine, and which it will therefore be unnecessary  to repeat. It is from the lips of such Mentors, that âtruthâ indeed  âprevails with double swayââone smile from them goes further towards  convincing than a dozen syllogisms.    Many years have now passed since I took that stroll on the banks of the  âdark rolling Hooghly;â many a hand I then clasped has since become  cold; and many a voice I loved to listen to, mute for ever; but the  scene remains pictured in my mind in strong and ineffaceable colours.    I think I now behold the group we formed, the white dresses of the  ladies, making them to look like spirits walking in a garden, and honest  Augustus, with his _solah topee_,[14] looking down on his shoes, and  saying agreeable things, the shadows of evening closing around us; the  huge fox bats sailing heavily overhead; the river spreading its broad  surface before us, suffused with the crimson flush of departing day; the  boats moving across it afar, their oars dabbling as it were in  quicksilver; the mists rising slowly from neighbouring groves stealing  over the scene, and then the stilly, tranquil hour, broken only by the  plash of passing oars, the sound of a distant gong, or the far-off music  of a marriage ceremony, or the hum and drumming of the bazaarâthose  drowsy sounds of an Indian eve. It was a bit of still life to be ever  remembered.    The guests for the _burra khana_ now began to arrive. Gigs, carriages,  and palankeens, flambeaux, dancing lights, and the musical groans of the  _cahars_, or bearers, as they hurried along the winding road, made the  generalâs domain, a few moments before buried in repose, a scene of life  and animation.    We returned to the mansion. The reception room was fast filling.  Generals, colonels, judges, barristers of the Supreme Court, merchants,  agents, writers, with their ladies, the _Ã©lite_ of Calcutta fashionable  society, was, now, for the first time, submitted to my observation.  White jackets, and still whiter faces, were the predominating features  of the group (except where relieved by English blood and up-country  brickdust), whose manners on the whole struck me as being more frank and  open than those of people in England, although that freedom occasionally  bordered, I thought in many, on a rough, familiar, horse-play sort of  manner, which then, at least, was too common in India, where the causes  which predispose to a disregard of courtesy are unfortunately too rife.    Some of the party discussed politics, horse-racing, the latest news from  up the country, the promotions and appointments, and so forth, in  groups; whilst others, four or five abreast, stumped up and down the  broad verandah, talking and laughing energetically; their spirits  evidently enlivened by the rapid locomotion in which they were  indulging.    General Capsicum was very pleasant with the _burra beebee_, a fine  stately old dame, with a turban of bird of paradise plumes, and with  whom, I afterwards learned he had actually walked a minuet in the year  of grace 1770. Mrs. Capsicum, surrounded by a group of military men and  young writers, was endeavouring to reduce her large mouth to the  smallest possible dimensionsâmincing the kings English, and âtalking  conversationâ âmighty illigantâ to the whole ring, in whose countenances  a certain mock gravity indicated pretty evidently what they thought of  her.    At last, the _khansaman-jee_, or chief butler, a very important and  respectable personage, with an aldermanic expansion of the abdominal  region, a huge black beard, and a napkin hanging from his _kummerbund_,  or girdle, with hands respectfully closed, head on one side, and an air  most profoundly deferential, announced to the general that the dinner  was served â_Tiar hyn?_â    âDinner ready, did ye say?â said the general, who was a little deaf, and  turning up his best ear to catch the reply.    â_Han khodabund_â (âyes, slave of the Lord),â repeated the  _khansaman-jee_.    âCome, gintlemen; come, leediesâthose who have any mind to ate may  follow me.â    Thus saying, the general, with great _gaitÃ© de cÅur_, presented his arm  to the old lady of the bird of paradise plume, and hobbled off with her,  chattering and laughing, and followed by the whole company. I, the  _lanky_ griffin, brought up the rear, looking, on the whole rather  âsmall.â    The _coup dâÅil_ of a grand dinner party in Calcutta, given by a rich  merchant or high official, is a very splendid affair, and perhaps  eclipses anything to be seen in the mansions of persons of the same rank  in England.    The generals presented a brilliant sample of oriental style: a long and  lofty room in a blaze of lustre, from a row of wall lights; a table,  covered with a profusion of plate and glass, occupied nearly the whole  length of the apartment; the huge _punkahs_, suspended from the ceiling,  with their long fringes, waved to and fro, gently agitating the air in  the room, which would otherwise have been hardly endurable from the  crowd it contained.    There was much lively conversation, taking wine, and clashing of knives  and plates; altogether far less quiet, I thought, than at a dinner in  England. The peculiar feature, however, of the scene, and that which  marked most strongly its eastern character, was the multitude of  servants in attendance on the guests; behind each chair, on an average,  stood two _khidmut-gars_, or footmen, with black beards and mustachios,  and attired in the various gay liveries of their masters, adapted to the  turban and Indian costume; most of them were the domestics of great  people, and exhibited in their looks a good deal of that pampered,  self-satisfied importance, so often observable in our metropolitan  servants here at homeâthe vulgar reflection of their mastersâ  consequence. Many stood, their arms folded, with Roman dignity, gazing  consequentially about them, and mentally making their observations on  their fellow-servants and the guests. Dinner over and the ladies  withdrawn, the gentlemen closed up, and the conversation became more  general.    The Calcutta dinner parties are not usually scenes of uproarious  conviviality; yet, as this was the anniversary of some great event in  the history of the general, he seemed determined on its being celebrated  with something approaching to a âjollification.â âFill your glasses,  gintlemen,â said he, as we closed up after the usual loyal toasts, âand  Iâll give ye a sentiment that I remember was a favourite of my  fatherâs.â    There was a profound silenceâthe little veteran arose, and valorously  grasping his glass, and stretching out his arm, delivered the following,  with a rich brogue and a most determined emphasis:â    âMay hemp bind the man that honour canât, and the devil ride rough-shod  over the rascally part of the community.â    The sentiment was drunk with much glee, and many a hearty response,  followed by songs and speeches.    It was late when, taking leave of the generalâs family, I returned to my  room in the barracks.                                       CHAPTER XIII.      Having, by General Capsicumâs promised interest, obtained a fortnightâs  leave of absence, I took an affectionate leave of Grundy and Marpeet,  and sent on my two or three servants to Mr. Augustusâs boat, accompanied  by Teazer and the one-eyed bull-dog. The next day, in the early grey of  morning, I proceeded with him to Tollyâs Nullah, a creek near Calcutta,  communicating with the BalliaghÄt Passage, where the boat was lying. It  was a cool and pleasant morning, the air delightfully fresh. On our way,  we met several ladies and gentlemen of Calcutta on horseback.    In India, bathing and early rising principally contribute to create the  amount of health generally enjoyed there, which would be far greater and  less precarious than it is, were it not for an immoderate indulgence in  the pleasures of the table, which inflames the blood, disorders the  liver, and renders the whole system peculiarly susceptible of disease;  then steps in mercuryâthe remedyâwhich is a fearful shatterer of the  constitution, and in the end proves worse than the disease.    I would earnestly advise all my brother-griffins, if they value their  happiness, to live moderately and simply though generously, and to guard  against the insidious habit of drinking _brandy pawney_, to which a hot  climate offers strong and peculiar temptations. These precautions  observed, and the mid-day sun avoided, a fair average amount of health  may be enjoyed for years.    My friendâs boat rowed ten or twelve oars, and was of a kind a good deal  in use in Calcutta. The front part was decked, and behind it had a  cabin, with Venetian windows, occupying about half the length, and  rising several feet above the gunwale; inside there was a small table,  and on each side lockers, which served for seats; to the back of these  again were some cots or dormitories. It differed from the up-country  going craft in being keeled, and having on the whole far more of the  European long-boat build.    As we shot along the creek for a few miles, each turn gave us peeps of  the rich and luxuriant scenery of this part of Bengal. Gardens of  plantain, mango, and jack-trees lined the banks, intermixed with clumps  of the tapering bamboo; clusters of neat huts, with arched roofs,  appeared half-buried beneath their umbrageous foliage, through openings  of which, in the dim, chequered light, village girls, with water-pots on  their heads, might be seen gliding along, and imparting to the whole  scene an air of primeval and truly Eastern simplicity.    Here and there, in front of a hut, mantled with its creeping gourd,  would appear the milk-white cow or petted calf, picketed by the nose,  and munching his _boosa_[15] under the cool shade of the tamarind or  plantain, whilst kids and goats, in various picturesque attitudes,  sunned themselves on the ruined wall or prostrate tree. Sometimes we  came on fishermen, in their _dingies_, or canoes, with outspread nets  catching the much-prized _hilsa_;[16] or we looked on the dark peasantry  in the green rice-fields, engaged beneath a fervid sun in their various  rural occupations.    Occasionally we came suddenly upon a market, with its congregated fleet  of boats, and its busy, squabbling assemblage of villagers, fish, grain,  and vegetable venders, &c.; or a thannah, or police station, would break  into view, known by its picturesque burkundazes lounging about in front,  armed with spears or tulwars, and the portly, bearded thannahdar, _en  dÃ©shabille_, smoking his _kulian_ under the projecting thatch of the  entrance. The novelty of the scene, so truly un-English and Oriental,  delighted me, and my heart bounded with joy from a feeling of vitality  and freedom.    At length we began to approach those vast forests, called the  Sunderbunds,[17] stretching for two or three hundred miles across the  delta of the Ganges, and through a considerable part of which our route  lay. The vicinity of this wild tract was indicated by the gradual  termination of the cultivated country, and the commencement of the  half-reclaimed lands on the borders, presenting to the view stumps of  trees, patches of jungle, and some paddy fields, occasionally a few  scattered huts, with their sickly inhabitants huddled around them.    The boatmen being somewhat exhausted, and the tide on the turn, Mr.  Capsicum ordered them to drop anchor in the stream not far from the  shore, that they might refresh themselves. It was a curve in the river  where we brought to, deep and broad, and remote from the habitations of  men. The lazy dark tide rolled slowly on, its movement barely indicated  by a slight set in the current, with here and there a few tiny curling  whirlpools, which seemed to my imagination to tell of the fearful depths  and frightful monsters below. An open spot of green sward approached the  bank on one side, whilst beyond this, on both banks, the huge trees of  the sombre forest hung darkling over the Stygian streamâhere emerging  into light, as from a realm of dolorous shade which might have daunted  Rinaldo himself.    How my thoughts now flew back, awakened by the contrast, to the flowery  meads and crystal streams of merry England! My companion now ordered  chairs and his hooka to be taken to the roof of the boat, and there,  with a teapoy and tumblers between us, we seated ourselves at our ease,  a hearer with a large chattah, or umbrella, shielding us from the  noontide rays of a powerful sun. A few faint airs, wafting the chirp and  pipe of unknown birds, came fanning from the woods, which, with the  monotonous bubble of Mr. Augustusâs hooka, produced a tranquil and  soporific effect upon me.    In the little patch of grass meadow I have mentioned, which lay nearly  opposite to us, two or three miserable stunted white cattle were  feeding, one of them considerably nearer the margin than the others.  Whilst looking towards them, I thought I discerned something dark slowly  emerging from the water where the muddy shelving shore dipped into it. I  kept my eye steadily fixed upon the object, which evidently moved and  presented to my view the resemblance of two large foot-balls, at the end  of a rough log of wood. I directed my companionâs attention to it, at  the same time asking him what it was.    âThere, yonder,â said I, âjust beyond the tuft of reeds. See! see! it  moves.â    âOh, I perceive the rascal,â said he; âitâs a huge alligator, making a  point at that poor beast of a cow; but Iâll spoil his sport. _Bearah  Bundook laou juldee!_ bring up the rifle quickly.â    Ere gun, however, could be brought, the monster, as if anticipating our  intentions, suddenly rushed from his concealment, with a rapid and  wriggling motion, and in an instant had the unsuspecting cow by the  nose.    The poor brute struggled, her tail crooked with agony, her two fore-feet  stuck out, and bellowing most lustily, whilst the alligator hacked  rapidly towards the water, dragging the cow along with him.    âQuick! quick!â shouted Augustus, as the servant blundered along,  capsizing a bucket or two in his hurry, and handed up the gun.    âClick,â went the lockâthe rifle was pointed, but it was too late: the  scaly monster sunk with his prey, as the bullet cracked sharply over the  eddy; a few bubbles and a slight curl of the deep waters alone marking  the spot where the poor cow had disappeared in a doleful tragedyâher  last appearance in public.    âWhat a ferocious monster!â I exclaimed; âdo they often carry away  animals in this way?â    âOh, yes,â replied Augustus, vexed that he had been foiled. âAlligators  in the salt and brackish waters of the lower parts of Bengal are  dangerous and ferocious; but as you recede from the sea, for some reason  or another, they become comparatively harmless, and seldom molest man or  beast, confining their depredations to the finny tribe. Near my factory  they are continually carrying off the villagers from the ghauts, and I  have heard and believe, though I have never witnessed a case, that they  sometimes adroitly knock the fishermen from off their dingies by a blow  of the tail, and then snap them up in a moment.â    âWhy do not the people hunt and destroy the brutes?â I asked.    âThey require more salt to be put upon their tails than your sparrows at  home,â said Augustus with a roguish smile, which made me think that he  had been cognizant of an early attempt of mine in that way. âHowever,â  he continued, âafter a good many poor devils have been carried off,  blackyâs apathy is a little disturbed, and he does sometimes catch them  in the following manner. A party row slowly up the stream, dragging a  number of hooked lines after them; when these are arrested by the horny  hide of the alligator, as he lies in the mud at the bottom, they slowly  raise the torpid brute (who seldom makes any resistance) till he appears  above the surface; they then simultaneously dart a number of small  barbed harpoons into him, to the heads of which (whence the shafts are  made to detach easily) stout cords are fastened, and thus they secure  his body; to prevent his doing mischief with his jaws, they present a  stick, and when he seizes it with a snap, they belay a cord round those  formidable instrument of destruction.â    After the crew had refreshed, we pursued our voyage, plunging into the  dreary solitude, intersected by a labyrinth of creeks and rivers; on  each side arose a wall of forest, with a thick undergrowth of the most  luxuriant vegetation, springing from the fat alluvial soil.    The silence of death was around, broken only at intervals by the distant  crow of the jungle fowl, the cry of the deer, or the blowing of a  porpoise, and the measured dash of our oars, as we swept along,  sometimes on the surface of a broad river, with bright green trees on  each side, and black-faced monkeys chattering in the branches; at  others, in some lateral creek, where the boughs almost brushed our deck.    There is something solemnly impressive in such a scene, which seems  truly to speak in majestic tones of the power and greatness of the  Creator. Such a scene in the howling wilderness carries the imagination  back to that primeval period when man was not on this earth, when  shipless seas broke on voiceless shores, and the mammoth and the  mastodon roamed undisturbed amongst its silent forests and lonely  retreats.    Occasionally a Mugh or Arracanese boat, of peculiar construction, with  its broad-faced crew and banks of oars, laden with beesâ wax, ivory,  &c., glided by, or a raft, heavily laden with piles of wood or charcoal  for the Calcutta market, swept past us, a momentary relief to the  death-like loneliness of the place: the wood they carry is cut and  collected by a particular class of men, who pursue their perilous trade  in these jungles.    Sometimes, too, the continuity of the forest was broken by a cleared  patch, and piles of timber ready for lading; or the hut of one those  religious devotees or fakeers, whose austerity acquires for them the  respect of the ignorant and superstitious boatmen, whom, by their charms  and incantations, they profess to insure from assaults of the alligator  and the tiger. Boatmen, however, and even fakeers, are continually  carried off; but as superstition always counts the hits, and never  reckons the misses, a few favourable predictions sets all to rights  again.    At one of these fakeer stations, we made a halt, and a more wretched  locality for a man to take up his abode in imagination can scarcely  picture. A small spot of about half a quarter of an acre, was cleared  from the forest, and in the centre of it was a fragile hut of thatch and  bamboo, which a puff of wind might have blown away; a tapering bamboo,  with a small red pennon, rose above it, and a little clay durgah for  prayer adjoined, to indicate the sacred calling of the lonely occupant.    As we brought to, the fakeer came down to the boat, and was most  respectfully received by the crew. He was an aged man, withered up like  a potsherd, and smeared with dust and ashes; his long, grizzled, and  matted beard swept his breast, and a tiger skin was thrown over his  shoulders; he held a long stick in one hand, on which he supported his  bent, decrepid form, whilst in the other he carried a dried gourd-shell,  or calibash, to receive the contributions of the boatmen.    Here was a Trappist of the East, submitting to every danger and  privation from motives somewhat similar to those which actuate the  ascetic order all the world overâmotives which we cannot but respect,  however mistaken we may deem them.    Bidding adieu to this recluse of the woods, we once more pursued our  course to the eastward, and after nearly a dayâs rowing, changed it to  the north, following the line of one of the many rivers which, spreading  out as they approach the sea in various lateral directions in the  Sunderbunds, form that intricate maze.    In a little time, the forest became less dense, and a few miles more  brought us again into the cleared and cultivated country. Our eyes once  more rested with pleasure upon the green rice-fields, the patch of  sugar-cane, the cluster of coco-nuts, and the busy haunts of men.    âWell, Mr. Gernon,â said Augustus, âI suppose you are not sorry to be  nearly at the end of your voyage.â    âNo,â I replied; âthough I have been greatly interested by the wild  scene through which we passed. But how far are we now from the  Junglesoor factory?â    âNot far,â said my friend; âplease God weâll sup at my house to-night.  There, look!â said he; âdo you see yonder white building, and the thick  cluster of trees, overhanging it at the turn of the river?â    âI do.â    âWell, thatâs one of my out-factories; there Iâve ordered some of my  people to be in waiting with horses, or an elephant, to take us on to my  shop, which is about six miles inland.â    âAn elephant!â I ejaculated, as I mentally rubbed my hands.    The boatman plied their oars with redoubled vigour, their cheerful songs  and shouts bespeaking that buoyancy of hearts which an approach to  âhomeâ ever inspires amongst all mankind.    We now neared the white building, which proved to be a small temple,  crowning a little ghaut or flight of steps, running down to the waterâs  edge, backed by something like an old ruined fort or factory, overshaded  by masses of foliage of the banyan and peepul trees, growing out of  fissures of the walls.    On the crest of the ghaut stood an elephant caparisoned with his bright  red _jhoul_ and _howdah_[18] fanning himself with the branch of a tree;  hard by him were a couple of horses, saddled, and held by their _syces_  or grooms, each of whom bore a hog-spear; whilst near and around, groups  of villagers, factory servants, and followers of Mr. Augustus, in  various picturesque costumes and attitudes, some squatting in masses,  some standing, others reclining on the steps or abutments of the ghaut,  were all impatiently awaiting the arrival of the boat.    These groups, backed by the ruined walls, the massive banyan with its  twining roots, and a little sort of bungalow, or summer-house, on the  projecting bastion, which stood out in strong relief against the evening  sky, all constituted, when viewed in the mellow sunlight of the rich  Claude-like repose of the hour, a scene well worthy of the pencil of a  Daniell.    The boat moored, a lively meeting and embracing took place between those  on board and their friends at the factory, for the Indians, I have  observed, though in some thing apathetic, are remarkably affectionate to  their relatives.    Augustus himself now stepped ashore with all the dignity of a monarch  returning from exile to his dominions, amidst the bows and prostrations  of his rejoicing subjects. Great were the salaamings, and manifold the  signs of life, which his arrival caused in the group. The syces  tightened the girths of the horses; two stately greyhounds rose from a  recumbent posture, whilst a couple of little pepper and mustard terriers  ran yelping and wagging their tails to greet their master; the _mahout_  dug his _ankous_, or goad, into the elephantâs head, to rouse him from  his drowsy state of abstraction, exciting a loud trumpeting scream, as  he drove down towards the boat. The gomastah, or manager, a Bengalee, in  flowing muslin robes, now advanced with dignified salaam, and made a  report of how things had gone on in his absence, whilst a Portuguese, of  the complexion of charcoal, with a battered hat and white jacket, named  Alfonso da Silva, also had a great deal to say touching the recent  operations connected with the manufacture of his masterâs indigo.    âNow, Mr. Gernon,â said Augustus, âthese matters settled, which are you  for, a gallop, or a ride on the elephant? take your choice.â    âOh! the elephant,â said I, âby all means. I have never ridden on one,  and long to be on that noble fellow, who looks like a moving mountain.â    âThen,â said my kind-hearted host, âlet us mount. I see they have put  the guns in the howdah, and we may have a shot at something as we go  along. I must give you a lesson in shooting off an elephant, which is no  easy matter to a young hand. Here, _hauthee laou_ (âbring the  elephantâ).â    Another dig and another startling blast, and the leviathan was alongside  of us.    â_Buth! buth?_â said the driver, and down knelt the docile beast to  receive us.    The coolie, or attendant, now applied the ladder, to his side; Augustus  ascended, and I followed him. Here, then, was one of my Oriental  day-dreams realized, and I fairly boxed up on âthe elephant and castle.â    âTis a fine thing to be mounted on a gallant charger, to spurn the sod,  and, catching all his fire, to feel yourself âevery inchâ a hero; or to  dash away in a brave ship over the blue billows with a spanking breeze,  as free as the winds that propel you; but I doubt if even they can  impart such sensations as you experience when towering aloft on the back  of an elephant, nine feet high, moving, with majestic and stately  stride, through palmy scenes of orient beauty, you find yourself raised  far above the humble pedestrian, and taking in the whole country as with  an eagle glance.    We now started at a good, swinging pace, followed by the horses, whilst  sundry burkundazes and peons, with spears and staves, trotted on nimbly  before, clearing the way of the boys, cows, village pariar dogs, and  idlers. Thus we wound through the village, and soon entered on the open  country, which for the most part was perfectly flat, and bounded by  villages and topes of mango trees. Here and there the land rose a  little, forming a sort of rough pastures, on which herds of the black  slouching buffaloes were feeding, mingled with small white Bengalee cows  and bullocks, their bells tinkling, and tended by herdsmen enveloped in  blanket sort of hoods, with long sticks over their shoulders.    We had not proceeded far on the plain, when a horseman appeared in the  distance, approaching us at a hand gallop.    âHalloo!â said Augustus, âhere comes my neighbour and brother planter,  Mons. De la Chasse, as funny, but as good a fellow as ever breathed. I  hope you have a tolerable command of countenance, for youâll require it  when you hear our friendâs English.â    By this time Mons. De la Chasse was sufficiently near for me to  distinguish the Gaul in every lineament. He was a long and gaunt man,  with the face of a _vieux mousquetaire_, wore a white solah hat, with a  vast amplitude of brim, a white jacket, and long military boots. His  horse was a large hatchet-faced animal, of a cream colour, with a swish  tail, which, however, bore him along over bush and jungle in capital  style. As he approached brandishing a hog-spear, he rather brought to my  mind the picture of a Spanish bull fighter.    âVelcome! velcome! goot friend; glad to see you back,â said he, riding  up, and waving his hand as he wheeled his horse about âYou look ver well  by Jhobs.â    âThankyee, thankyee, Monsieur; allâs right with me, but what have you  been doing in this part of the world?â    âOh, de old vay. Ve have had de jodge down, and one of his amis, abote  some cochery affairs; had him out for a day after de hogue; killed two,  treeâone old boar give fine sportâver fine; near kill us though, by  Jhobs; ha! ha!âbut who that wid you, Capsicome?â    âOh! a young friend of my fatherâs come to see how we carry on the war  down here. Let me introduce him to youâGernon, Mons. De la Chasse, &c.â    âAppi see you amongst us, Sare.âBy de vay, I not tell a-you I have had  ânoder kick ope with dat Bobberygunge talookdar: dâm fellow, his bulloke  spoil twenty beegah my plant. I shall him have ope to de jodge, by  Jhobsâhe is aâaâa (casting about for a suitable expression, and setting  his teeth) a frightful shackass.â    This moved my risibles, in spite of a gentle poke from Augustusâs elbow,  and a reproving look compounded of gravity and laughter. Fortunately, at  this juncture, a dismal yell broke on our ears, and we perceived ahead  of us, slinking across the plain, two animals somewhat larger than  foxes.    âWhat are they?â I asked.    âOh! a couple of jackals,â said my companion. âWould you like to see a  run?â    I eagerly expressed my assent.    âDe la Chasse,â said Mr. Augustus, âtake a gallop after those jackals;  our friend here wants to see a hunt.â    âOh! ay, veâll stir dem ope,â said the light-hearted Frenchman, who,  like his countrymen in general, seemed ready for any thing that promised  excitement. â_Choorda khoota choorda!_â (âlet loose the dogs, let  looseâ) he shouted, and in a moment the greyhounds were slipped.    âHark away!â shouted Augustus; the Gaul gave the View halloo, and after  the jackals darted the beautiful animals; their bodies undulating like  serpents as they emulously strove to pass each other. The small dogs  followed in full cry, and my _matur_, or master of the hounds, not to be  outdone, and justly anxious for the reputation of his charges, drew the  cords of the bull-dog and Teazer, lustily cheering them on.    After killing the jackals, which was soon effected, we regained the  road, and in half an hour reached the Junglesoor factory. The residence  was a square building of one story, surrounded by a terrace and covered  verandah; on one side was a large garden, filled with orange and other  trees. Further back were groves of bamboo, mango, &c., intermingled with  buildings, vats, stables, &c.    We dismounted, and Augustus invited the Frenchman to come in and sup;  but he declined, pleading a necessity for returning home; but he added,  âVen vil you come take your _luck-pote_ vid me?â    âHa! ha! ha! _pot-luck_, I suppose you mean, Monsieur?â    âYais, to be sure,â said the good-natured Frenchman; âbut I put de horse  before de cart only. What you mean, you dam Capsicome, by laugh at me?â  said he, poking at him with the butt-end of his hog-spear.    After other good-humoured passes between them, it was arranged that La  Chasse was to come over the day after the ensuing, to breakfast, make a  day of it, and âhunt ope de hogue,â and he was to bring a friend.    I now entered with my companion, and proceeded to the dining-room. We  found the candles lighted and every preparation for a comfortable meal.  We had a roast goose, curry-fish, prawns, &c., to which we did ample  justice; a cool bottle of claret was then produced; Augustus changed his  boots for slippers, cocked his legs on the table, ordered his hookha,  and another for the purpose of initiating me, and we were soon in that  blissful state, compounded of overflowing health, light hearts, moderate  fatigue, and a delightful sense of repletion, when the heart expands,  and all the better feelings of our nature predominate. I have always  thought, though an inversion of the orthodox rule, that the first and  most effectual step towards making men good is to make them happy.    The following day was devoted by Augustus to repose and domestic  arrangementsâthings having fallen a little into arrear during his  absence. In the course of the morning, however, he took me round his  estate, showed me his garden, his stables, and his farm-yard; also his  indigo vats, his drying-houses, &c.; whilst exhibiting the latter, he  explained to me the process of manufacturing the dye.    The morrow at length arrived, the sun rose in splendour, the weather for  the season (the beginning of October) was breezy and cool, and all  things seemed to wear a propitious aspect, and to promise a delightful  dayâs sport. In a short time, De la Chasse arrived, accompanied by a  square, tight-built little man, named Tupper, who had recently (as is  not unfrequent in India) changed his berth of mate of a country ship for  that of an Indigo planterâs assistant.    An abundant breakfast duly despatched, there was a buckling of spurs, a  slinging of brandy-bottles, an examination of hog-spears, and other  preliminary movements for the foray. Outside, too, was a great muster of  Augustusâs retainers, coolies or factory men, real âblue demons,â in  almost Paradisaic costume, with long sticks, or _latees_, over their  shoulders, wherewith to beat the jungles.    Augustus now vaulted on his Arab, a beautiful creature, with a high  reputation, as I was told, as a hog-hunter (horses in India enjoy the  sport as much as their masters), and with his spear in hand gave the  signal for departure. Out marched the whole cavalcade, I mounted on a  sturdy little hill pony, called a tangan, as hard-mouthed and headstrong  a little devil, as I afterwards discovered to my cost, as ever tumbled a  griffin.    Each of us hunters was armed with a spear, whilst spare ones were  carried by the syces. The spear used in this sport, by the way, is a  very formidable weapon. The shaft is about seven feet long, the head an  elongated heart, or rather leaf-shape, as keen as a razor, and to aid  its murderous effect, the butt-end is loaded with about a half-pound of  lead.    We now wound along, bending our course for the banks of a river, where  wild hogs and other game were said to abound. Having crossed the plain,  we found, ourselves amongst mango groves and woodland, interspersed with  scattered huts and small villages, and I became, by some accident,  separated a good distance from my companions.    In passing the edge of a tope, or mango grove, an adventure happened,  which, though somewhat derogatory to my dignity in its results, my  integrity as a historian obliges me to relate. A pause in the narrative  may, however, be expedient, in order to give me the requisite degree of  composure.                                        CHAPTER XIV.      In passing the grove mentioned in the last chapter, by the edge of a  fosse, or ditch, overgrown with bushes, and not far from some miserable  huts, I thought I heard a rustling, and reining up my tangan and  listening, I could distinguish the deep bass of a grunter, with the  running treble of sundry little pigs. My heart went pit-a-pat; here,  thought I, is a glorious discovery! I shall be the first to rouse the  grizzly monster from his lair, and launch a spear at him. I wished,  however, to be sure, and listened againââtwas a palpable grunt.    âYoicks! tally-ho!â shouted I, waving my hat, as a signal for my friends  to come up and share in the anticipated sport.    Roused by my voice, and a stone cast into the ditch by my syce, an  unclean beast of large dimensions, black and mangy, issued therefrom,  and, rather leisurely, I thought, for a wild boar, jogged across the  open space, followed by a tribe of young ones. Now then, Frank Gernon, I  mentally exclaimed, gird up the loins of thy resolution, and prepare for  desperate deeds.    Thus internally soliloquizing, I slacked my rein, put spurs to my  tangan, and, spear in hand, rode furiously at him. La Manchaâs knight  did not charge his windmill more valiantly. I pushed him hard, but he  kept ahead, dodging, joltering, and grunting, and for the life of me I  could not place myself in a position to give him the _coup de grace_. At  length, by vigorously urging my beast, I found myself alongside; my arm  was raised; the glittering javelin poised with as direful a presage as  that of one of Homerâs heroes; already in imagination my burnished point  had searched out the seat of life, and I saw the crimson tide distilling  from the wound; I rose to deal the mighty stroke, when snap went the  stirrup-leather, away flew my spear, and I, and not the hog,  incontinently bit the dust. Yes, down I came, a thundering thump.    Painful was the revulsion of feelingâI never felt more foolish in my  life. Away went pig and tanganâand so they might, for aught I  caredâwhilst I, like a dying gladiator, lay prone on the earth, applying  vigorous friction to my shoulder. In a few seconds, my companions rode  up, to my confusion, convulsed with laughter, which they vainly strove  to repress.    âYouâre not hurt, I hope, Gernon?â said my host, endeavouring to compose  his features into a look of commiseration (a dead failure, by-the-bye).    âNo, not much,â said I, writhing with pain; ânothing to speak of. It was  that confounded rotten stirrup; but I should not have cared, had I  speared the hog.â    Upon this, there was another volcano of laughter. I felt annoyed, and  begged to know, fiercely, what they found so amusing in a friendâs  nearly breaking his neck.    âOh, my good ami,â exclaimed the Frenchman, âyou most pardonnezâbut ha!  ha! ha! you ave hunt the village pig, ha! ha! ha! and not the vild  hogue. Oh, mon Dieu, je vais mourirâoh! oh!â    âYes,â added Augustus, âoh! oh! oh! you really must excuse us, Gernon,  he! he! he! for laughing a little at your griffinish mistake; indeed,  you have been chasing a villager; but you are not the first that has  made such a blunder. Come,â he continued, âhereâs your steed; mount once  more, and weâll show you some real sport. I see you are game to the  backbone, and will prove a staunch hog-hunter.â    I was mortified at my blunder, but this piece of flattery acted as a  cataplasm to my wounded spirit; so I thought it best to join in the  laugh against myself, and remounting my tangan, and re-adjusting the  stirrup, we once more continued our route.    After crossing a bare plain, we found ourselves on the banks of the  river, covered for miles with a belt of grass and long reeds. The  beaters were now put in, and dismal yelling and shouting commenced. In a  few minutes the cry of _sewer, sewer!_ (âhog, hog!â) arose from many  voices; the reeds ahead waved and rustled, and in a moment a tremendous  boar burst from the cover, and bore right away across the hard plain,  towards the cultivation.    Away went Augustus in gallant style, with a yell or war-whoop that made  the welkin ring. The second mate joined chase right before the wind; my  little hard-mouthed Punch stuck down his head, laid back his ears, and,  unbidden, followed next, keenly alive to the sport, though I had a hard  matter to manage him and my long spear to boot; and in a moment more the  Frenchman thundered past, with brandished spear and horse tight in hand.    âHa! ha!â said he, as he passed me, ânow you vill see de death of de  veritable vild hogue.â    Augustus gained on the boar, who, with his milk-white tusks, bristly  back, and sidelong look, presented a most formidable aspect, and was  evidently an ugly customer. The planter pushed him closely, and, in  passing, delivered his spear with such effect, that it stuck bolt  upright in the back of the boar, who nevertheless continued his onward  course, as if spitted for the feast.    It was now the turn of De la Chasse; up he came, and in capital style  delivered his spear with a _coup de thÃ©Ã¢tre_ just behind the shoulder,  wheeled round his horse with a âha! ha!â and the monster rolled over and  over. He was a magnificent boar, with a hock like a bullockâs, terrific  tusks, and such a neck of brawn! eâen such a brute as one sees Madame  Diana flying after, barelegged, in an old tapestry, or playing pitch and  toss with a score of dogs in one of Snyderâs noble pictures. But âtwas  all up with him now; his little blood-shot eyes were half-closed, his  tongue was out, and all his sinews and muscles were stiffened in death.    ââTis ver fine hogue,â said the Frenchman, looking up, after  contemplating, him for some minutes in mute delight, and pulling out his  gory spear, buried two feet deep in the shoulder; âbut I give him dat  last poke ver well, eh! by Jhobs?â    âYes, you certainly finished him in very sportsmanlike style, Monsieur,â  replied Augustus; âI thought he would have charged me as I delivered my  spear, and am glad he did not, for with those tusks of his, gentlemen,  he would have been an ugly customer, and have left his mark on my  gallant Rustum and me. But come, we will try up the river again.â    The legs of the boar were now tied, a pole was thrust through them, the  huge animal was hoisted on the shoulders of four of the coolies, and  home along with us.    The beaters now once more advanced, latees waved, the shouts were  renewed, and in a few minutes there was a cry of some animal, when a  creature of the deer kind, of a slate colour and clumsy shape, bolted  from the reeds, and with an awkward up and down sort of movement, made  across the plain.    âA hog-deer,â shouted Mr. Tupper; and with arms and legs working like a  mannikins, spurred after him, the rest of party following.    The hog-deer have little speed or bottom, so he was soon overtaken and  killedâcasting up a piteous look, as Augustus, who on this occasion gave  the Frenchman the go-by, drove his keen spear into him.    After the death of the deer, we all by acclamation voted an adjournment  to a neighbouring shady tree; there dismounting, and throwing ourselves  on the ground, we commenced a vigorous attack on the cold meat and pale  ale, chatting, joking, laughing, and masticating, at one and the same  time. The game was laid out before us, in order that we might feast our  eyes on that, at the same time that we gratified our palates.    [Illustration: Returning Home from the Hog Hunt.]    The lunch fairly discussed, I was surprised to see a servant hand a  small hookha, or _kulian_, covered with silver chains, and emitting a  delicious odour, to Augustus. Upon my honour, I mentally exclaimed, you  indigo gentlemen seem to have a good notion of comfort. Mr. Augustus  wiped the mouth-piece with his thumb and finger, put it between his  lips, and emitting an elaborate whiff of a yard and a half long, slowly  leaned his back against the trunk of the tree, half-closed his eyes, and  exhibited the most perfect appearance of unalloyed sublunary bliss I  have ever beheld. After half an hourâs rest, and partaking of the  _kulian_, which was generously passed round by our friend, we arose, and  prepared for a renewal of the campaign.    In this we were as successful as in the commencement of the day. Three  more small hogs were killed; on one of which, after sundry abortive  attempts, and one or two imminent risks of unshipment, I fleshed my  maiden spearâa feat marked by such uncommon skill and unique adroitness  on my part, that I made it the leading subject of conversation for a  month afterwards.    Our sport over, and man and beast fairly exhausted, we now bent our  course towards home, wending our way over the plain we had crossed in  the morning. We four cavaliers, our spears over our shoulders, mounted  on our steeds of various statures, led the way; then came straggling  attendants, lagging heavily along; and lastly, the goodly show of game,  slung on poles, and borne on the shoulders of coolies, brought up the  rear.    The cavalcade, the game, the wild track of reeds, the distant masses of  wood topped with the coco-nut and betel-palm, all seen in the streaming  light of the setting sun struggling through the eveningâs haze, would  have made a fine subject for that prince of animal painters, Landseer.    A pleasant meal at my friendâs house closed this my first dayâs  hog-hunting in India. I had become a mighty hunter at once, and stood  two inches higher whenever the feats I had witnessed crossed my mind;  the feeling of exultation would have been unalloyed indeed, but for the  adventure of that cursed village pig.    The supper was capital, and, ye powers that preside over gastronomy, how  we did eat! It is a fortunate dispensation of Providence that all men  are not hog-hunters, or frequent famine would be the inevitable result.  Augustus was pleasant, the Frenchman loquacious, Mr. Tupper had much to  say, and the hogs were, at a moderate computation, slain over again half  a dozen times at least before supper was ended.    Amongst other subjects incidentally discussed, was that of several  dacoities, or gang-robberies, lately committed in the neighbourhood,  attended with great atrocities.    This part of Bengal had long been famous, or rather infamous, for these  plunderers, who, led on by their chiefs, the Robin Hoods of India, were  a terror to the country. The bands move about, at times levying  contributions from the inhabitants, in numbers often sufficiently great  to enable them to defy the police, which is, or was, very  inefficientâtheir leaders are great desperadoes.    âI hear,â said Augustus, âthat Ramsunker has been plundering in this  neighbourhood, and swears he will pay me a visit one of these days; but  let him come, and weâll endeavour to give him a warm reception.â    De la Chasse and Tupper said they should like nothing better than a  skirmish with the banditti, and begged that Augustus would send off an  express for them if the aforesaid Ramsunker should ever make his  appearance at the Junglesoor Factory.    Augustus promised to do so, saying that he should be equally ready to  attend their summons if they were first selected for plunder; in short,  a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, was then and there  struck; after which the high contracting parties, becoming full of  Bacchus, sung several songs, disputed, quarrelled, became maudlin, wept,  swore everlasting friendship, and retired to rest.    Besides that one to which the permanent residence was attached, Mr.  Augustus had several out-laying factories, which he visited from time to  time, to superintend the manufacture of his indigo; at all of these he  had little bungalows, or temporary abodes, where we tiffed and passed  the heat of the day.    We were one morning at the factory on the river, where I have stated  that we first landed, quietly smoking in the little turret, or  summer-house, when a great hubbub below, and the noise of people  running, saluted our ears. Mr. Augustus rose hastily, and ran out to see  what was the matter, I following him, at the same time despatching a  servant to ascertain the cause of the uproar. He soon returned, and  stated that a youth had just been carried off from the ghaut by an  alligator, which had snapped him up whilst in the act of washing his  cloth or _dhotee_.    Excited by this account, we posted off to the ghaut, where a clamorous  crowd was collected, many of them looking and pointing towards the  centre of the river. On inquiry, we learnt that the alligator was there,  playing with his victim; and, casting our eyes to the middle of the  stream, there, sure enough, in the centre of the rapid current, his long  jagged tail rising above and occasionally lashing the surface, was the  monster, tossing and shaking the lifeless body of the poor black boy,  and amusing himself as a cat does with a mouse before she makes a meal  of it.    Mr. Augustus sent immediately to the bungalow for his rifle, which soon  made its appearance: it was a piece of the kind called commonly in India  a âbone-breaker,â and carrying a weighty ball, eight or ten to the  pound. Having loaded it, he took a deliberate aim at the alligator.    I waited in breathless suspense for the resultâbang went the rifle, and  the ball dashed up the spray within a foot of the creatureâs head, and  then went ricochetting over the expanse of water.    âA close shave,â said Augustus; âbut come, weâll try him again.â    Once more the rifle was loaded and fired, but on this occasion with more  success, a dull, lumpish sound telling that the ball had taken effect.  It requires, however, ordinarily, many balls to kill an alligator; but  down sunk the head of the monster, his long serrated tail waving in air  as he descended to the depths of the river, like a sinking warrior  flourishing his broken brand.    This fellow, it appeared, had long been carrying on his depredations in  this part of the river, and the boatmen and fishermen determined at last  to make an attempt to capture him; this they next day effected in the  usual way by dragging the bottom with hooks.    We slept at the out-factory of Gurrialpore that night, and were  agreeably surprised the next morning, shortly after breakfast, by a man  running in to inform us that the alligator had been captured, and that  the muchwas, or fishermen, were then in the act of towing him on shore.  We immediately proceeded to the riverâs brink, and there, sure enough,  we observed two dingies, or canoes, fast approaching, and lashed closely  side by side.    As they came near, we perceived that the alligator was between them,  well secured, his head above the water and projecting in front between  the prows, and his long tail laving in the wake behind; in his huge jaws  was a stout stick, well belayed with a cord above and below; in short,  bridled and bitted for any gentleman who, like the adventurous Mr.  Waterton, might have felt disposed to take a ride upon him, which, not  being particular, and preferring a horse myself, I certainly felt no  inclination to do.    On the boats touching the shore, we stepped on board, and looking  between them, found the space, a breadth of a foot or two, occupied by  the horny and rugged back of their prize, into which were wedged the  barbed heads of some half a dozen small iron harpoons, with cords  attached in the manner I have mentioned in a former chapter.    By dint of ropes and bamboo poles, the natives, who showed themselves  wonderfully adroit at the business, soon had him on the shelving bank,  when my host proceeded very deliberately to put ball after ball through  his head, to the number of four or five.    This, for any description of landsman, would have been more than enough;  but, as I before observed, an alligator is an inordinate glutton in the  way of punishment, and requires much to give him his quietus. However,  he was considerably damaged, no doubtâsufficiently so to admit of his  being easily thrown on his back, care being still taken to prevent his  doing mischief, by the pressure of long bamboo poles on his body and  tail.    One of the muchwas now, with a sharp axe, or some such instrument,  proceeded to cut him open, and having done so, he removed the intestines  as completely as the cook does those of a fish preparatory to consigning  it to the frying-pan.    Mr. Augustus now gave the order to remove the âpressure from without,â  which was accordingly done, when, strange to relate, but nevertheless  perfectly true, the _unkillable_ monster sprang bodily up, recovered his  natural position, and lashing his tremendous tail right and left, made  both the dust and the crowd to fly, the latter skipping off nimbly, and  giving him what sailors term a wide berth. Thus he continued to lash his  tail and move his liberated jaws for some time after, though unable to  stir from the spot.    This extraordinary tenacity of life is common to all reptiles and  cold-blooded creatures, though not in all to an equal degree; it is very  remarkable in the turtle of the Indian rivers, which I have known to  scuttle off to the water _minus_ their heads, when cut off by the  enraged _piscator_, as the shortest way of getting the hooks out of  their mouths.    As I watched the dying throes of the alligator, after so long resisting  all attempts to extinguish his vital spark, under every circumstance of  advantage to his assailants, I could not help feeling in all its length  and breadth the utter state of impotency to which the lord of the  creationâmanâwould be reduced, however well supplied with weapons,  offensive and defensive, when once fairly grappled by him in his native  element. Humiliating thought!    A _post mortem_ examination of the alligator showed us Mr. Augustusâs  ball firmly wedged into the thick part of the tail; and an analysis of  the contents of the stomach brought to light two legs, half an arm, and  sundry rings and silver bangles, which had once adorned the slender  limbs of some hapless village maiden.    Having now gratified our curiosity, and performed our duty to the  public, the inquest broke upâverdict, of course, âjustifiable  _alligatricide_ââand we returned home.    One morning, a few days after thisâthe most eventful, as will be seen in  the sequel, which had occurred to me since I had trodden Indian  groundâwe were seated at table after breakfast, my host drowsily smoking  his hookha and conning the Calcutta paper, I concocting a despatch for  home, when suddenly a confused and distant noise was heard, including  the rapid beat of a _doog-doogie_, or small native drum.    My host laid down his paper and listened; for a moment it died away,  then again rose on the wind; there was a hubbub of voicesâof flying  footstepsâand lastly, of one or two dropping shots.    âBy heavens! thereâs something wrong,â said Augustus, half-rising from  his chair, and still intently listening. â_Quon hye?_â (âwho waits?â)    The words were scarcely uttered, when, wild with alarm, a servant rushed  in followed by one or two others, exclaiming, in almost frantic tones,  âSahib! sahib! _dacka! dacka!_â    My host turned pale, started from his chair, and rapidly interrogated  the affrighted men, who answered him all clamorously at once, and with  the most animated gesticulations.    âIn the name of all thatâs good,â said I, thunderstruck at the scene,  âwhat on earth is the matter?â    âMatter! my dear fellow, the dacoitsâthatâs all; the robbers are upon  us; we must defend our lives; there is not a moment to be lost.â    The plot now began to thicken: three burkundauzes rushed in, with a  confirmation of the intelligence that Ramsunker and his gang were close  at hand, bent on fulfilling their recent threats, and that they had  already plundered two or three neighbouring hamlets.    Not an instant was wasted; the doors were banged to and bolted in a  trice, bars laid across, and some heavy boxes piled up against them.  Guns, pistols, and hog-spears were put in requisition; the burkundauzes  loaded their matchlocks and blew their matches, and the whole of us  immediately ascended to the flat roof, determined to defend the  fortress.    Having gained this position, the next point was to reconnoitre the force  of the enemy, and the posture of affairs outside.    A low parapet wall, some three feet high, encompassed the flat roof of  the planterâs mansion; and over this last, sheltering as much of our  persons as possible, we cast our eyes in the direction of the mass of  bamboo and other foliage, amongst which the indigo vats and other  out-buildings were principally situated.    All there was ominously still, except that, every now and then, a  factory coolie, like a startled hare, would burst forth from his  concealment, and with looks of terror, fly across the opposite  rice-fields.    The vat-houses, &c., had now, it was clear, been abandoned by all the  planters followers, and were in possession of the dacoits, who were  probably rifling them. Of this we had speedy confirmation, by perceiving  three or four dark, undersized figures, almost naked, and armed with  swords and spears, creep cautiously out and cast furtive glances towards  the house.    âThere they are,â said Augustus: âthose are some of the rascals  preparing, no doubt, to make an assault upon us. Well, we must give them  a warm reception. I wish with all my heart we had De la Chasse with us;  but how to communicate with him and the distant police station,  surrounded as we are, I know not. However,â he added, âhe cannot fail  sooner or later, to learn our situation from some of the runaways. Here,  Gernon,â said he, handing me a double gun, âhere is something for you;  now do your best, like a valiant knight, and win your spurs.â    Here, thought I, is a pretty adventure! I shall inevitably be figuring  in a return of killed and wounded, without ever having joined a  regiment. Call you this a party of pleasure, iâfaith? I had soliloquized  to this extent, when a little white cloud of smoke puffed itself forth  from the brightly verdant screen formed by the drooping bamboo hedge,  followed by the whistling of a matchlock ball within a few feet of my  pericranium.    To tell the truth, this music had no particular charms for me; though,  when âhonour pricked me on,â I could listen to it awhile, buoyed up by  visions of glory, promotion, prize-money, and so forth, as well as  another.    On hearing the whine of this ragged missile, I instinctively bobbed my  head a shade lower than the parapet wall: this little involuntary  working of the conservative principle, however, was speedily succeeded  by an energetic display of its opposite, as by an active rebound up I  started, presented my gun, and dropped shotsâone, twoâquick as thought,  into the spot from which the cloud of smoke had yet hardly  disappeared;âhow many I killed, I canât say.    Augustus also fired; and immediately, as if roused by our daring, a  numerous band of some 200 or 300 dacoits, as ill-looking a set of  fellows as I ever beheld, armed with swords, spears, and a rusty  matchlock or two swarmed forth from their places of concealment, rushed  down upon the house with a frightful yelling, sprung upon the terrace,  and endeavoured to force the doors. These, however, though rather  fragile, as Indian doors generally are, were sufficient for the moment  to resist their efforts.    Our garrison replied by loud shouts of defiance, which, with a volley  from the guns and matchlocks, sent them, to our astonishment, to the  right-about, and they again sought shelter amongst the trees, carrying  off two or three wounded.    I congratulated Mr. Augustus on their unexpected retreat, expressing a  hope that we had seen the last of them, for the disparity of force went  far towards diminishing the liveliness of the joke.    âAh!â said my friend, âI would not have you halloo before youâre out of  the wood, or draw precipitate conclusions; I know the villains too well;  they have plenty of pluck, and are now, depend on it, going to make sure  of us in some way attended with less risk to themselves.â    We now listened, and soon heard the sound of axes in the wood, followed  by the crash of falling bamboos.    âWhat can they now be at?â said I.    âI suspect,â replied Augustus, âthat they intend to scale the house, and  are making ladders of bamboo for the purpose.â    Some conversation with the native garrison tended fully to confirm this  view of the matter, and 200 or 300 to eight or ten are overwhelming  odds.    âI fear,â said the planter, âwe must beat a parley, unless immediately  relieved by De la Chasse or the thannah folks, and make the best terms  we can for ourselves, or they will scale the roof, massacre us all in a  trice, and then plunder the place. What is your idea of the matter,  Gernon?â    âOh,â said I, âIâm for fighting as long as thereâs a fair chance; but if  thereâs none, as Iâve no wish to âadorn a taleâ by figuring in a  massacre, I vote with you that we give in, provided they grant us an  honourable capitulation.â    As we were thus speaking, a servant exclaimed that a man was advancing  from the wood where the dacoits were carrying on their operations: he  was unarmed, and made a sign that he had something to communicate. One  of our intelligent burkundauzes hailed and asked him what he wanted.    The reply, as explained to me, was, that he had a message from his  sirdar, or chief, the redoubtable Ramsunker, to deliver to the sahib.    He was told to advance with confidence, that he would he admitted to  deliver his message, and that no harm would be done to him. On the  promise of safe-conduct, the herald came forward, nowise distrustful,  and was forthwith admitted.    He was a middle-sized but wiry and athletic fellow, intensely black,  half-naked, with matted hair, small, loosely-twisted turban, and a broad  untanned leathern belt over his shoulder.    Being asked by Mr. Augustus what he had to say or propose, he replied,  that he was sent by his sirdar to state that he was now making ladders,  with which he would in a few minutes scale the house at all points, and  put every soul to death, unless his terms were at once complied with:  these were the immediate payment of Rs. 300, upon which he would at once  draw off his band, and give no further molestation to any one.    The indigo planter, finding further resistance would be useless, and  knowing that these dacoits, on the principle of honour amongst rogues,  were men of their word, fulfilling every engagement, whether to rob and  murder, or abstain, with scrupulous fidelity, determined on acceding to  their terms; this he intimated to the little plenipo, who thereat made a  salaam, grinned horribly a ghastly smile, and returned to report to his  superior the success of his mission.    To be brief, there was an immediate stir in the grove, and presently the  chief, as sinister-looking a villain as I ever beheld, came forward to  about the middle of the open space fronting the house, accompanied by a  body of some ten or twelve of his followers.    Mr. Augustus gave him a bag containing the Rs. 300, for which he made an  obeisance, and then wheeling about, he rejoined his band, who, after  several loud shouts, moved off with their plunder, and without offering  us any further annoyance.    âWell,â said Mr. Augustus, shaking me by the hand, âhow do you find  yourself, after being stormed and besieged?âa pretty piece of business  this, eh? You little thought of witnessing such an adventure, Iâll be  sworn, when you came down to sport at the Junglesoor Factory. This was  not the shooting you expected.â    âI did not, indeed,â said I; âhowever, I think we have saved our honour,  and our bodies are certainly intact, albeit you have lost your rupees.â    âThatâs true,â said my friend; âbut I should still like to give the  rascals a trouncing and recover the _spolia opima_, and will try it, if  De la Chasse and the police make their appearance before they have got a  long start of us.â    This was scarcely said when we heard the sound of horsesâ hoofs, and in  a moment De la Chasse and Tupper, in breathless haste, came spurring up  to the house. The former threw himself from the saddle, and in a moment  had us by the hands.    âMy goot Capsicome! my dear young friend! are you all aâlive? all well?  Datâs goot; thank Godâthank God! I hear you vas beseiged by dis raskal  dacoit; so Tupper and me, ve mount our âorse, ride off to the tannah for  de policeâdey vill be here directly, tannahdar and all, little and pig.  But come, tell me _vraiment_ all vat was happenâvere are dey?âwho have  dey kill?âvat have dey rob?âvere are dey gone?âCome tell it all, for I  am dam _impashant_ to know all.â    âIt is soon told, Monsieur,â said Augustus. âRamsunker and 300 of his  men attacked us; we stood one assault, capitulated, and paid Rs. 300,  black-mail, to get out of the scrape.â    âBlack male! vat de devilâs black male?âyou mean, I suppose, you pay Rs.  300 to de black malesâI not suppose you pay to de black females.â    Augustus laughed, and explained.    âVell, vell, you did your best; de grand Napoleon himself vas obleege to  yield to numbers; 300 to ten is too moch. But,â added he, âI do hope ve  may yet catch dis dacoit, get de money back, and give dem goot trashing  beside; dere is 100 of de police, and twenty or thirty more of usâvat  say you?â    âJust what I was proposing to our young friend here, as you came up;  undoubtedly, let us try; but thereâs no time to be lost, if we would  wish to succeed, for they have already a considerable start of us.â    The proposal, indeed, was generally relished; the horses were ordered to  be saddled; each of us armed himself in some way or other, and in a few  minutes more, the portly thannahdar, or head of the police, as burly a  fellow as Shakspeareâs fat knight, mounted on a rat of a pony, made his  appearance at the head of a numerous body, some 80 or 100, of the  neighbouring police, drawn from several stations.    Mr. Augustus intimated to the thannahdar his determination to pursue the  dacoits, so soon as his followers had slightly refreshed themselves, of  which, after the distance they had come, they evidently stood in need.  This the thannahdar intimated to his men; some of whom began to smoke in  little knots or groups, squatting on their hams; others drank water,  which they drew in their brazen lotas from a neighbouring well; whilst  others unfolded little stores of rice, or parched gram, tied up in  corners of their vestments, and set to daintily picking and eating the  same. Poor prog to fight upon, thought I, holding as I do that the  stomach, and not the heart, is the seat of valour.    All the above was mingled with an incessant gabble touching the recent  event, with a plentiful outpouring of abuse on the female relations of  the aforesaid dacoits.    The police refreshed, off started our little army in pursuit of the  enemy, who we calculated could not be many miles off, the four  Europeans, (if Augustus may be included under that denomination) and the  thannahdarâthe cavalry of the divisionâtaking the lead, whilst the  police peonsâthe infantryâprincipally armed with spears and tulwars,  brought up the rear.    As we advanced, we learnt from the villagers that the body of the  dacoits (too large to move unobserved) had proceeded in the direction of  a certain ferry on the river. Thither we bent our course, and learnt  from the ferry people that they had recently crossed and were close at  hand. The remainder of the adventure I shall sum up in a few words.    The dacoits were soon overtaken; like CÃ¦sar, we came, and sawâwould I  could add, we conquered! but in that, the most essential point, the  parallel with the great Romanâs despatch unhappily fails.    On approaching the dingy array of the dacoits, they halted and showed a  bold front. Augustus and De la Chasse marshalled their men, and  addressed what were intended for some spirit-stirring exhortations to  them. Tupper and I took the flanks, and doubtless felt (I can speak for  myself) rather queer.    We advanced; the dacoits, sword and spear in hand, came forward doggedly  to meet usâour line waveredâin vain we screamed and exhorted; the  dacoits dashed inâcut down three or four; _sauve qui peut_ was the word,  and away flew our men over the plain. After a little irregular cutting  and slashing, we followed, and with difficulty saved ourselves by the  speed of our cattle.    I will leave the reader to imagine the rage of Mr. Augustus, the  vehement _pestes_ and _sacres_ of the Gaul, and the downright  straightforward abuse of the stiff little mate, elicited by this  shameful misbehaviour of our troops; the censures, reports, &c., arising  out of it; and the uneasiness felt, after we had got back to the  factory, of another visit from the exasperated Ramsunker. Fortunately,  however, he came not; and from fugitives and others we learn that,  satisfied with putting us to the rout, he had made off with his gang and  booty to a distant part of the country.    All this, of course, formed matter for animated discussion and  commentary amongst us four at the factory, De la Chasse and his friend  remaining for a couple of days to afford us their countenance and  protection. We had a very merry time of itâshooting and boating in the  day, and a rubber of whist or a song at night.[19]                                        CHAPTER XV.      I had now been about twelve days a visitor with my hospitable friend,  the indigo planterâa period, as the reader has seen, fertile in  eventsâwhen I began to think of returning, and a letter or two which I  received served to hasten my departure. One was from an old friend and  schoolfellow, Tom Rattleton, a good deal my senior, and whom I had not  seen or heard of for four or five years. It ran thus:â      MY DEAR FRANK,      It was by the merest chance that I heard from a Captain Marpeet, who    has been staying here, in his way up, of your arrival in India. How I    missed seeing your âwell-knownâ name in the papers or General Orders I    really cannot imagine. Marpeet says, you only want a little more of    his tuition to become a _ne plus ultra_âin short, I must not tell half    the handsome things he has said of you; but in all I could not fail to    recognize, clearly and distinctly, my old class-mate and companion of    the third form.      How I long, my dear fellow, to have a good dish of chat with you about    school-days, and all the fun and frolic we have had together in times    past! Do you recollect lame Tomkins, the pieman, and your unsuccessful    attempt to prove to him, synthetically and dialectically, that long    credit and great gains were preferable, as a mercantile principle, to    small profits and quick returns, to which logic many an empty pocket    sent forth, doubtless, a confirmatory echo? But oh, that stony-hearted    man! Orpheus himself could not have moved himâno eloquence, no    wilesânought but the _ipsa pecunia_, the moneyâs chink.      My regiment has lately arrived here from Berhampore. I have been for    some time out of my griffinage, and though but a âjolly ensign,â like    yourself, and not very deep in the mysteries of the _Hindee Bolee_,    have lately obtained the command of a companyâwe being rather    deficient in old hands. This works me a good deal, but I like my new    powers, and if I could but understand the fellows, I should get on    famously.      I have a small bungalow near the river, and am comfortable enough, all    things considered, so you must come and spend a month with me at    least. Why not get to do duty with our regiment at once? it can be    easily managed. I hope you enjoy life amongst the âTrue Bluesâ in the    Mofussil. I have had some experience of them myself, and a    kinder-hearted and more hospitable set of fellows, taking them in a    body, does not exist.      Give me a few lines to say on what day I may expect you here, and I    will ride out and meet you (if you dawk it) and have breakfast ready.    So for the present adieuâ_au revoir_.                                           Your friend and schoolfellow,                                                             T. RATTLETON.      P.S.âBy-the-bye, do you recollect your changing old Thwackemâs    digestive pill, daily deposited at the corner of his desk, for a pea    rolled in flour (or a bolus of your own manufacture), and how    unsuspectingly the old boy would gulp it down, preparatory to locking    up his cane and descending from his awful elevation? Many a good laugh    Iâve had at this piece of _friponnerie_ of yours.    This letter delighted me, and Mr. Capsicum, to whom I read it, seemed  also a good deal amused. I felt an intense longing to see my friend Tom  again, and in fact fell into such a fidgety and excited state, that I  could take an interest in nothing. Old Time, instead of flying, seemed  to me all of a sudden to have lost the power of locomotion altogether.  Battleton and I were the Castor and Pollux of the school, sworn  brothersâbackers and abettors of each other in all fights, scrapes, and  difficulties, of which we generally had _quantum suff._ on hand.    School was truly a black passage in my life, in which the happiness was  to the misery in about the proportion of honest Jack Falstaffâs bread to  his quantum of Sherris sack.    â_Ah, chien de livre, tu ne me fera plus rÃ©pandre de pleurs!_â exclaimed  the enraged Scipio of Le Sage, as he wreaked his vengeance on the  â_maudite grammaire_,â the passive instrument of all his sufferings.    I can too well understand the feelings which actuated, on this occasion,  the little son of the honest usher of St. Hermandad, for never to this  day do I enter a school-room, or my eye light on a grammar, dictionary,  or other buff-coloured associate of the long-past days of my pupilage,  but a host of painful and degrading recollections rush on my mind, of  the hundred thwackings, confinings, mortifications, of which they were  the proximate cause, as nauseous to the feelings as the remembrance of a  black dose, or Jamesâs powder, âgrating harsh musicâ through its  envelopment of black-currant jelly. And as I look at a pedagogue, I have  such a lively idea of a caning, that I am glad to get out of his way.    The young mind may, in truth, be likened to the notes of an instrument,  from which a harmonious result can only be extracted by the hand of a  master, acquainted with their respective powers; whilst a bungler may  thump away at them to the end of the chapter, and nothing but discord,  or the instrument irretrievably put out of tune, will be the  consequence. In fact, the art of developing, governing and improving  âthe young idea,â the most important of all, is yet in its infancy,  particularly as regards the moral training.    But to curb my erratic vein, and proceed with my narrative.    A period having been fixed for my departure, Mr. Augustus asked me in  what manner I proposed to return. I told him, that was a matter I had  not considered, but that I should be entirely guided by him.    âWell,â said he, âthereâs the boat you came in at your service; but the  Sunderbunds are roundabout, and Iâd strongly recommend your going by  dawk; youâll find it pleasanter, as youâre alone, and youâll reach your  destination much sooner.â    âVery well,â I replied, âlet it be so; but may I ask what mode of  transport this said dawk is of which I have heard such frequent mention  madeââtisnât any sort of animal, is it?â    âAnimal!â exclaimed my friend in astonishment, and laughing heartily,  âwhy you are a greater griffin than I took you for: this beats your  spearing the village pig. A dawk is a relay of bearers at stages of ten  or twelve miles apart, to carry you, at the rate of four or five miles  an hour, to your journeyâs end.â    âThank you,â said I, âfor the information; but not possessing intuitive  knowledge, you see, one canât be expected to know all things until told  of them.â    Augustus admitted that there was reason in the observation.    Well, it was decided that I was to proceed to Barrackpore on the second  night after the day on which this conversation took place; so I wrote at  once to my friend Tom, to tell him that he might expect me immediately.    The last day of my stay, De la Chasse and his _fidus Achates_ dined with  us, and we all appeared depressed at the prospect of separation, for our  short acquaintance had already ripened into a friendly feeling.    Like towns in an ill-governed country, where, owing to the absence of  sound laws and honest administrators of them, every one is afraid of his  neighbour, hearts, in artificial England, are too often petty  fortresses, in which pride, caution, and suspicion are incessantly on  the watch to guard against surprise, and to break down these barriers  and effect a lodgment is frequently the work of years; but in India,  amongst Anglo-Indians, the case is reversed; the gates are thrown wide  open, and intimacies and cordial (though, perhaps, not always lasting)  feelings are generally the result of a few dayâs acquaintance.    Both extremes are bad, as all extremes are; but it is indubitably far  pleasanter to live amongst those, the approaches to whose confidence and  kindness are supinely, rather than too rigorously guarded; the one  system, âtis my belief, shuts out more good than the other admits of  evil.    â_Sahib, ka daktiar hyr_,â said a servant entering the apartment some  time after dark, on the day of which I am speaking.    âGernon,â observed Mr. Augustus, âthe best of friends must part: your  palankeen is ready outside, and only waits your orders.â    I arose, walked to the terrace, and there was my equipage. The  sentimental St. Pierre, with all the _accuracy_ of a Frenchman, thus  describes the equipage of his truth-seeking doctor, who, if as subject  to blundering as himself, might have been a long time in discovering  that valuable treasure.    âThe Companyâs superintendent of Calcutta furnished the doctor with  everything necessary for his journey to Juggernauth, consisting of a  palankeen, the curtains of which were of crimson silk, wrought with  gold; two relays, of four each, of stout coolies or bearers; two common  porters; a water-bearer; a juglet-bearer, for his refreshment; a  pipe-bearer; an umbrella-bearer, to shade him from the sun; a nuslogee  (!) or torch-bearer, for the night; a wood-cutter; two cooks; two camels  and their leaders, to carry his provisions and luggage; two pioneers, to  announce his approach; four sepoys, mounted upon Persian horses, to  escort him; and a standard-bearer, bearing the arms of England!â    I, being no philosopher, and bound on a less important mission, could  pretend to none of this splendour; my turn-out consisted of a palankeen,  eight or ten cahars or bearers (for in my time, whatever may have been  the case in the doctorâs, it was not usual to carry the palankeens upon  coolies); a bangby, or two baskets, containing my immediate necessaries,  slung on an elastic bamboo; and a mussaulchee, or link-bearer; the torch  carried by the latter being formed of rags rolled about an iron spindle,  and looking something like a bandaged stump.    I thought there would have been no end to the handshaking and last  âadieus,â with the repeated injunctions not to forget that I should  always find a knife and fork and a hearty welcome at the Junglesoor  Factory.    At last, however, I âbroke away,â as the fox-hunters say, I believe, and  threw myself into the palankeen; the bearers, with a groan, lifted their  burthen on their shoulders; the mussaulchee poured oil on his link from  its long-spouted receptacle, which, flaring up, brought out the whole  scene, house, trees, and congregated group on the terrace, with a wild  and spectral glare. I waved my hand, half-closed the doors of my  palankeen, threw myself back:âthe curtain had dropped on act the second  of my griffinage, and I was soon on my journey to Barrackpore.    On we went, through the murky gloom of night, dispelled for fifty yards  around by the glare of the mussaul; sometimes on a fair and beaten  track, at others, splashing through wet rice-fields, or traversing with  infinite caution some causeway or embankment, as perilous as the bridge  of Al Sirat.    The monotonous _Urree-hy-he-haw_ chant of the bearers soon sent me off  into a doze, from which I was only aroused occasionally by blundering  attempts to put me and my palankeen on board a boat, in crossing some  lazy river, on which occasions, the torch-light, the red glare on the  water, and the dark figures on board, would bring old Charon and his  Stygian ferry to my imagination; or the disturbance arose when they set  me down, not over gently, on the skirts of some village or thannah,  preparatory to a change of bearers.    At the end of the first stage, one of my active bipeds opened the doors  of my palankeen, popped in his greasy frontispiece, reeking with oil and  perspiration, and, with a grin, said something I did not understand, but  in which the word _buckshish_ (presents) was remarkably distinct.    âGo to the dââl,â exclaimed I; âboxes, no _sumjha_[20] boxes.â    My friend now tried it on another tack, and, placing the finger of one  hand in the palm of the other, with a knowing look, repeated the word  ârupee.â    Oh, thought I, are you there? I see your drift; but, knowing they had  already been paid, I abruptly closed the doors and the conversation at  once, with thundering â_Jow-jehanum!_â[21] a phrase I had picked up  (without knowing the precise meaning of it) from Capt. Marpeet, who, in  his intercourse with the natives, made frequent use of it, as a sort of  receipt in full.    I passed the greater part of the following day with a planter on the  road, a friend of Mr. Capsicumâs, and started again in the evening.    The fresh air of the morn aroused me after my second nocturnal journey,  and I looked out. We were in a rich, flat, and luxuriant country; all  nature seemed smiling; the ryot was moving out to his work, and ruddy  streaks appeared through the tall, tufted stems of coco-nut and  taree-palms, blushing Aurora truly looking out of the barred casements  of the East.    I calculated that I must now be nearly at the end of my journey; and  this supposition was, in a few minutes, most agreeably confirmed by a  young officer, in a red raggie and hunting-cap, riding up on a pony, and  addressing a few words to my bearers in Hindostanee.    I looked hard at him, and in an instant recognized the well-known  features of my schoolfellow, Tom Rattleton. The recognition was mutual,  and electrical the effect; out I rolled, _sans chapeau_; off he tumbled  from his tattoo, and we were soon locked in a close embraceâaye, I say  in a close embrace; true affection, like true courage, is a desperate  grappling affair, and a mere handshaking would have been high treason to  the feelings which at that moment swelled our bosoms.    âMy dear Frank!â    âMy dear Tom!â    âHow glad I am to see you!â    âHow you are grown! but I should have known you anywhere, old fellow.â    âSo should I you, old boy.â    âWellâehâand how goes it?â    Thus we exploded a volley of queries and interjections, which escaped by  fitful jerks, like water from bottles suddenly inverted. There was no  acting here, but a hearty burst of honest natureâfresh as the morning  air we were breathing.    The warmth of our greeting a little subsided, I resumed my recumbent  position in the palankeen, and on went the bearers, jolting along at a  rattling pace, having apparently caught all our animation, with revived  hopes of â_buckshish_.â Rattleton trotted alongside, talking  incessantly, and in a short time the military cantonment of Barrackpore  broke in view.    We crossed the parade, where all was life and animation; soldiers  drilling, recruits on one leg doing the goose-step, drums beating,  drill-sergeants shouting, and bugles sounding.    We passed through the lines, thronged with sepoys in their graceful  undress, and were soon at my friendâs bungalow, in which, after  dismissing my bearers, I entered to take up my quarters. Rattleton gave  me another shake, as if he had been working a pump handle and cordially  bidding me welcome.    A certain writer, who laid the scene of a romance in India, when not  quite so well known as at present, describes our hero, I have been told,  as sailing in a bungalow on the broad and placid surface of the Ganges,  which, by a slight geographical error, is made to traverse the vale of  Kashmere. Now, though I give my reader credit for knowing something more  of the matter than this, a slight description of a bungalow may not be  unacceptable, nevertheless.    The houses occupied by Europeans in India are of two descriptions; the  _pucka_ houseâ_havilee_, or _kottee_âand the bungalow. The former of  brick or stone, is flat roofed, and, excepting in Calcutta, almost  always of one story; _i.e._ the rooms are all on the ground floor,  though considerably raised from the ground; they have green Venetian  windows, and are encompassed, wholly or partially, by a terrace, covered  with cement, shaded by a verandah or awning.    The bungalow partakes more of the cottage, or, I should perhaps rather  say, the barn, being, in nineteen cases out of twenty, covered with a  ponderous thatch, requiring frequent renewal, the operations of the  white ants and periodical rains soon converting it into a cake of mud,  through which pactolean rills frequently find their way to the interior,  meandering down the walls.    The bungalow is invariably of one story, and constructed on the  principle of a single or double-poled tent, or routie, according to the  size; the resemblance to tents occupied by officers is indeed striking,  though which is the original and which the copy I cannot say. It has  usually double walls, though in some cases that which answers to the  outer is little more than a range of pillars.    The space between, called the verandah, is occupied by masterâs  palankeen, camp equipage, &c.; there, too, the bearers, or _cahars_, lie  and snore during the sultry hours, till roused from their slumbers by a  kick from masterâs foot; there, too, the patient _dirgee_, or snip, sits  cross-legged, hard at work on the beebee sahibâs ball-dress, or the  sahibâs nether garments, which he holds on with his great toe and the  next one to it with all the skill of the Order _Quadrumana_, to the  astonishment of the griffinish beholder.    Talk of our âlight fantastic toes,â indeed; what are they to a black  fellowâs,âadorned, too, with a fine silver great-toe-ring to boot! _Mais  revenons_. The ceilings, instead of lath and plaster, are composed of  coarse cotton cloth, whitewashed, and tied with numerous tags or strings  to a framework of bamboo running round the apartment, and concealed from  view by the projecting cornice; between this and the rafters is a dark  void, the airy hall of the rats and bandicoots, who sometimes hold their  _soirÃ©es dansantes_ and _conversazione_ in it, careering over the cloth  with lively and varied squeakings. _Purdahs_, _chicks_ (blinds), and  _jhamps_ (frames of straw and bamboo), and sometimes glass doors, serve  to close the entrances; the latter are, indeed, pretty common, except at  very uncivilized and out-of-the-way stations.    Furniture harbours reptiles and is expensive to carry about; officersâ  bungalows are, consequently, but slenderly supplied with moveables. A  couch, one or two tables, half a dozen chairs, a book-shelf, a  _settrinjie_ (or cotton carpet, with blue and white stripes, and which  also serves for the tent when marching), and a few wall-shades &c.,  generally constitute the adornments of an Indian officerâs residence.    In the abodes of civilians, whose lots are cast in pleasanter places,  and who lead less erratic lives than the military, and have far longer  purses, things approximate more nearly to the English standard of luxury  and comfort.    At military stations, puckha flat-roofed houses are rare, and generally  occupied by the general commanding, or some other exalted functionary in  the receipt of large allowances.    My friendâs bungalow was a regular Indian subâs abode, and fell wofully  below my standard of comfort, though in his opinion, formed on more  experienced views of Indian life, it was quite as it should be.    In the first place, the grand _salon_, or _salle Ã  manger_, contained  one square camp-table, two chairs and a half, a footstool of basket  work, in the shape of a devil (the thing played with two sticks, I  mean); his hog-spear and gun occupied one corner, and hard by hung  suspended his library; not quite so large as the Bodleian, to be sure,  but containing, nevertheless, some very good cut-and-come-again sort of  books.    First, there was a family Gibbon, properly docked and curtailed, a  present from his grandmother; Gilchristâs Grammar; Williamsonâs _Vade  Mecum_, and Taplinâs Farriery; the _Tota Kuhanee_,[22] Mother Glassâs  Cookery, and a ponderous _tome_, which I at first took for a Family  Bible with explanatory notes, but which turned out to be an abridgment  of the rules and regulations of the Bengal army, monuments of the  legislative skill of all the commanders-in-chief and governors-general  from the time of Clive downwards.    Tomâs dormitory was still more scantily furnished: it contained a small  camp-cot, on which, much at its ease, reposed a terrier bunnowâown  brother to Teazer, I could have swornâa chair, a washhand stand, or  chillumchee, a cracked looking-glass, two camel trunks, and as many  _pataras_; whilst on a peg hung what he sometimes jocularly termed his  badges of slaveryâto wit, a sword, a sash, and shoulder-belt.    The third apartment in the bungalow, small and bare, was assigned to me,  and Rattleton good-naturedly sent a servant off to the fort to bring up  the things I had left there in a _paunchway_.    After showing me the interior, we proceeded to the shady side of the  bungalow, where, on a terrace, stood a chair, a teapoy, a small carpet,  and other preparations for my friendâs second toilet. After parade or  the morningâs ride, it is the invariable custom to dress again, an  operation which, in the hot seasons, is repeated sometimes two or three  times in the course of the day.    We should be rather surprised to see gentlemen in England sitting _al  fresco_ on the lawns, barring a short pair of drawers, as naked as  gladiators; but, as I said before, the sun makes a very considerable  difference in our perceptions of things in general.    Prior to dressing, it is usual to take a bath, which is effected by the  _bhisteeâs_ (water-carrierâs) sluicing over you the frigid contents of a  _mussack_, or tanned sheepskin bag. This braces the whole system, and  adds a fresh edge to the appetite, already sharpened by the ride in the  morning air. Breakfast is, consequently, attacked with a degree of  vigour and determination not often seen even in our hyperborean clime.    After a comfortable meal, and disposing of a vast quantity of fish,  rice, and muffins, Rattleton cocked his legs on the table, bade me do  the same, and make myself quite at home. The pipeman brought the hookha,  and the bearer pulled the punka, and we proceeded to discuss a plan of  proceeding for the morning.    âIn the first place, we must call on the colonel this morning,â said  Rattleton; âhe is a very good sort of man, takes matters easily, and  patronizes me especially, but is rather tenacious of having proper  respect paid to him; then, after that, Iâll introduce you to the  general, and some of the other officers of the corps and station, and in  the evening weâll drive you out in the park, where youâll see all the  beauty and fashion of Barrackpore. By the way, Frank, there are some  devilish nice spins just now here, which, perhaps, youâll not be sorry  to hear.â    âCertainly not,â I replied; âbut I hope, Tom, youâre not thinking of  committing matrimony just yet, are you?â    âWhy, I donât exactly know,â said Tom; âthereâs a very sweet little girl  here, who has made a sad hole in my heart; such a pair of eyes as she  hasâoh! Frankâbut youâll see. I have made a hundred resolutions against  being spliced, but one glance of those death-dealing orbs sends them all  to shivers in a minute. I am like a moth flitting about a candle, and  shall go plump into the mischief at last, I see that very plainly.  Perhaps, though, Frank, as you are not a bad-looking fellow, you may  keep down or divert a little of the fire of that terrible artillery.â    âWhy, I donât know,â said I, laughing; âit is not so easy to create a  diversion in these cases, and not over safe; besides, who knows, if  successful, but that the fire of your love may be changed into that of  jealousy, and that you may be opening another sort of battery on me! But  seriously, I can feel for you, Tom, for already my poor heart has been  amazingly riddled by a charming young lady we left at Madras, and more  recently by a widow. âPon my life, I begin to think the Orientals do  wisely in locking up their women.â    [Illustration: Tom Rattleton receiving the Morning Report of the âFat  Lordâ and the âRed Lion.â]    âI begin to think so too,â said Tom, with a sigh: âthey do a confounded  deal of mischief; at all events, those radiant and Mokannah-visaged  dames should be closely veiled with good opaque stuff, as you muzzle  dangerous dogs.â    âWhat a simile, Tom! But your plan would be of no avail; a mere masking  of the battery, which, upon fit occasions, would open upon us with more  deadly effect.â    Whilst we were thus chatting, the blind of the room was drawn aside, and  Cherby Khan and Loll Sing (which translated mean âthe fat lordâ and âthe  red lionâ), the subadar and lance-naick or corporal of my friendâs  company, marched in to make their morningâs report.    A native of Hindostan, well off in the world, and with a mind at ease,  fattens as regularly and surely as a pig or a stall-fed ox. The subadar  was consequently a punchy, adipose little fellow, something of the cut  and build of â_Mon oncle Gil Perez_.â The naick, on the contrary, was  tall and spare, and a very proper and handsome man of his inches.    On entering (stiff as a ramrod), the little subadar, who showed a good  civic rotundity in front, threw out his right arm horizontally, with a  jerk, which might have almost dislocated it from the shoulder-joint, and  then bringing up his hand to his cap, saluted in a most military style,  and reported that âall was well,â â_sub ucha_â in the company of the  â_Gurreeb Purwar_,â or âprotector of the poor,â for so he designated my  friend Tom.    This was the statement in the gross, with which, however, it appeared  there was little correspondence in the items; these proved, I afterwards  understood from Tom, to beâtwo men dead, five gone to hospital, three  deserted, a musket lost, and sundry other mishaps.    The âred lionâ now stepped briskly forward, as if going to knock Tom  down; recovered his arms with a crack, which made me almost jump out of  my chair, and proceeded at once to âunfold a taleâ of considerable  length, to which my friend replied, â_Ucha_,â[23] and â_Bhote  khoob_,â[24] though it was pretty clear, from his perplexed look and  embarrassed air, that he did not understand one-third of it. In point of  fact, the aforesaid statement was evidently one which involved some  knotty point for âthe protector of the poorâsâ decision, and requiring  something more tangible in the way of comment than the aforesaid â_Bhote  khoob_.â    My friend, however, dismissed him with a â_Peechee hookum_,â âorders  deferred,â a sort of âcall again to-morrowâ phrase, much used in India,  when time is sought to be gained. Another salute from the subadar,  another formidable crack of the fusee from Loll Sing, and both wheeled  on their heels, and _exeunt_. â_Buggy lou juldee_â (âbring quick the  gigâ), â_Jal kreech do_â (and âgive me my sash and swordâ), shouted  Rattleton.    A sort of whiskey, which my friend sported on his ensignâs pay, was soon  at the door. He was duly equipped, and in we both stepped, and drove off  to the bungalow of Colonel Lollsaug, the commandant of my friendâs  regiment, which I shall call the 95th N.I., or â_Zubberdust  Bullumteers_.â    We were ushered in, and found the colonel smoking his hookha, with a  sneaker of cold tea before him, a sort of prolongation of the breakfast  almost universal in India. He rose as we entered, and shook hands with  Tom, who presented me as his friend recently arrived.    The colonel was a gaunt figure of six feet two, or thereabouts, with  sallow sunken cheeks, and two little tufts of grizzled whisker near the  corner of his mouth; he was dressed in a not uncommon morning  dishabille, consisting simply of a shirt and red camlet jacket, a pair  of immense _pajammas_, or native trousers, tied with a silken string at  the waist, whilst an immense pair of spangled Indian slippers, with  curly toes as long as ramsâ horns, adorned his feet; an embroidered  velvet scull-cap was perched on the top of his head: and altogether he  was as striking a specimen of the epicene gender of the Orientalized  European as I had as yet seen.    The colonel asked me if I had recently arrived? how I liked India? what  the folks were doing at home? if St. Paulâs stood where it used to do?  and sundry other questions of a like nature, to all of which I gave  suitable replies.    Rattleton told him we were old schoolfellows, and that I had a strong  desire to do duty with his corps for a month, if it could be so  arranged. The colonel kindly undertook to manage the matter, and told  Tom to introduce me to the adjutant, who would have me instructed in the  drill, and manual and platoon, with some other young men then with the  regiment.    The colonel now asked my friend if he had been at the grand ball an  evening or two before, and how it went off?    Tom said he had, and they had a very pleasant evening, second supper,  lots of dancing, and some good songs, and that there were strong  suspicions that the general was a little â_fou_.â    âWell,â said the colonel; âthatâs all right, but was _she_ there?â    âWho, sir?â asked my friend, very innocently.    âCome, come, that wonât do, Mr. Slyboots,â said the colonel; âI know all  about it; ha! ha! ha!â    ââPon my honour, sir,â said Rattleton, blushing, âyou are too  enigmatical for me.â    âCapital,â said the colonel, who was in a bantering humour; âwhy,  Prattle tells me itâs all settled, license written for, and that you are  going to cart her[25] immediatelyâha! ha! ha!â    I saw, of course, that all this had reference to the spinster with the  fine eyes. Though my friend affected ignorance of the matter, he was  evidently flattered by being made the subject of such an agreeable _on  dit_.    Whilst this was going on, I was startled and surprised by seeing the  head of a very pretty Indian lady, with jet black locks, large gazelle  eyes, and a huge gold ring in her nose, pop from behind the _purdah_, or  curtain, and the owner of which exclaimed, at the top of a very shrill  voice, â_Urree Dhyya Paundaunneelou_.â[26]    The colonel said something rather sharply.    â_To vau_,â pettishly exclaimed the apparition, and the head and a  pretty be-ringed hand were withdrawn, and immediately from an opposite  door an elderly black duenna, with a pair of wrinkled trousers, or  _pajammas_, and half-concealed by a cowl-like sort of muslin robe,  marched in a stately manner, _sans cÃ©rÃ©monie_, her anklet bells  jingling, right across the apartment, with a huge metal box under her  arm, which I afterwards learnt was a betel-box, and which it seems was  the article which the colonelâs sultana stood in need of.    Egad, thinks I to myself, they order things in the East rather  differently from what they do in the West.    After a little more conversation we took our leave, having previously  received an invitation to dine the next evening with the quaint  commandant.                                        CHAPTER XVI.      The space to which I have limited myself in these Memoirs will not admit  a minute account of all I saw, heard, said, and did, during my months  sojourn at Barrackpore; it will, therefore, suffice if I touch lightly  on a few prominent characters and occurrences illustrative of Indian  life, during this period of my griffinage.    âTom,â said I, as we left the colonelâs bungalow, âdo tell me who that  fine dark damsel was, with the ring in her nose, of whom we had a  glimpse from behind the curtain.â    âWhy, thatâs the native commandant,â said Tom.    âNonsense,â said I; âwhat do you mean?â    âWhy, I mean that the colonel commands the regiment, and she commands  the colonel.â    âHa! ha! well, thatâs made out logically enough, certainly; but in that  way I suspect youâd have no difficulty in proving a peticoatocracy all  the world over: man, good easy soul, fancies himself a free agent, puffs  and struts, and is but a puppet after all, of which woman pulls the  strings, and yet these provoking creatures are always complaining of  want of power and due influence.â    âWell done, Frank; ably put, my boy. I see youâre as great an inductive  philosopher as ever; itâs a true bill though; the strongest fortress,  too, has its weak points. Thereâs the colonel, for example, a  deeply-read man, understands everything, from metaphysics to a red  herring; will touch you off a page of Xenophon, or a chapter of  Sanscrit, with perfect ease; a man who has thought and read, and read  and thought, in that Fortunatusâ cap and those curly-toed slippers of  his, for the last thirty years, in all the leisure of camp and  out-station, fort and jungle; brave as a lion, generous as a prince, and  in most matters firm as a rock; and yet that little Delilah can wheedle  and wind him round her finger as she pleases. She makes half the  promotions in the regiment, I am told; and no one better than blacky  understands the value of back-stairs influence, and the mode of working  it successfully. But by all accounts these are the men who square best  with Jack Sepoyâs notions of a proper commander; these are the men whom  they would go to the devil to serve; who know how to treat them in their  own way, and not your pipe-clay, rigid disciplinarians, who would  utterly extinguish the native in the soldier, who make fine troops for a  parade, but bad ones for the tug of war, or when their loyalty is  assailed. Itâs splendid to hear the colonel talk to the Jacks; he  understands them thoroughly; can make them roar with laughter, or shake  in their shoes, as he pleases; true it is, if you would govern men  effectually, it must be through the medium of their peculiar feelings  and prejudices, and not by taking the bull by the horns.â    As he said this, we drove into a pretty extensive compound, and drew up  before a large puckha-house, with a bevy of servants and orderlies in  the verandah; this was the residence of the general commanding, to whom  I was presented in due form.    Tom next took me to the adjutantâs, and the rest of his  brother-officers, of whom he promised to give me some account on a  future occasion, and then we went home to tiffin.    In the evening we had a delightful ride in the Governor-Generalâs park,  and as we wheeled along through its mazy rounds, saw all the beau monde  of Barrackpore, as also my friendâs innamorata, with whom we had some  very lively conversation, as we drove slowly alongside the barouche in  which, with a party, she was taking the air.    Having visited the menagerie in the park, stirred up the tigers, and  plagued the monkeys a little, we drove to Colonel Lollsaugâs.    The colonel gave us an excellent dinner, wine admirably cooled, foaming  pale aleâIndiaâs prime luxuryâand some capital home-fed mutton. There  were five or six officers present, and the conversation, which was  unrestrained and agreeable, turned upon old recollections of former  stations; on the prospect of promotion and war or rather war and  promotion, for such is their natural order; and gave me a greater  insight into what was passing in the Indian military world than I had  yet enjoyed.    Being young, and a griffin, I thought it was better for me to listen  than to be prominently loquacious; and it was fortunate that I adopted  this conclusion, for, amongst other topics, the extreme forwardness and  assurance of the youth of the presentâ_i.e._ of that dayâwas discussed  with much animation.    âItâs too true, I fear,â said the colonel; âthey donât conduct  themselves as the young lads did in my juvenile days. I remember,â said  he, with the regretful air of the _laudator temporis acti_, âwhen I was  a young man and first came out, we thought it necessary and proper to  exhibit some little deference and respect to our seniors in age and  rankâsome reserve and diffidence in our opinions, not, however,  inconsistent with a due degree of firmness and self-respect; but now,  forsooth, your beardless younker, fresh from school, claps you on the  shoulder, and is hail-fellow-well-met with you in an instant, exhibiting  all the confidence of a man of fiftyâquite destitute of that  master-charm of modesty, which, in man or woman, takes so powerful a  hold on the affections and good-will.â    These observations, though perhaps true in themselves, I thought a  little ill-timed, and not wholly consistent with his own proceedings.  However, they were cordially assented to by some of the âold handsâ  present, particularly by one ill-dressed, caustic, and slovenly old  captain, named Langneb.    âYouâre right, colonel, quite right, sir; theyâre all major-generals  now, sir, at starting; know everything and care for nobody. Thereâs  young Snapper, who joined us the other dayâan idle, dissipated young  scamp; keeps four horses, gives champagne tiffins, and is spending three  times the amount of his payâhailed me only last night in the park by my  surname, sirâno prefix, by George! no handle, though I havenât spoken to  him five timesâtold me I had got a pretty beast there (meaning my  horse), and asked me for the loan of my buggy to-morrow! What do you  think of that, sir? Never met such a forward, self-sufficient young  fellow in all my life; but heâs going to the dogs as fast as he can.â    âI am afraid he is,â said another; âbut thereâs some allowance to be  made for him. Thompson, who knows his family at home, tells me he was  brought up by a doating grandmother, who spoilt him, indulged him to the  top of his bent, never contradictedâmoney _ad libitum_âthings all his  own way: hence pride, selfishness, and an inordinate love of pleasure,  the natural results. Never send your children to be brought up by  grandmothers; owing to their unbounded affection, which passes through  the parent as through a lens, theyâre sure to spoil them.â    A rubber of whist and a game of chess concluded the evening very  pleasantly at the colonelâs. At parting, he told me with great kindness  that he hoped soon to see me on parade, and that he had desired the  adjutant to take me in hand, and give me a little preliminary  instruction.    The next day Rattleton took me another round of visits to some of the  married men of his acquaintance, many of whom seemed agreeable people,  but possessed of various degrees of refinement; also to the houses of  two or three widow ladies residing at the station, all of whom had  pretty daughters or nieces seeking that which it was natural and proper  they should seek, eligible partners, youthful âJohn Andersons,â with  whom to jog up the hill of life together.    It was abundantly clear, and I soon discovered, that Rattletonâs little  affair of the heart had got wind pretty extensively, for wherever we  went he had to run the gauntlet of banter and sly innuendo in one shape  or another. Like Mr. Dangle, however, with his âvolunteer fatigueâ and  âsolicited solicitations,â he bore it all very philosophically.    Tom was a handsome fellow, and it was well known that he was to have the  first vacant regimental staff appointment, his aunt being married to a  first cousin of the Governor-Generalâs military secretaryâs second  wifeâs first husband. Under these circumstances, my friend ranked as an  âeligible,â and the old ladies could not forgive him altogether for  passing over the more valid claims of their daughters and nieces; and  the daughters and nieces, though they endeavoured to conceal their  chagrin under the guise of a very transparent indifference, were  evidently not a whit more satisfied with Mr. Rattletonâs presumed  election in favour of Miss Julia Heartwell.    The first widow to whom we paid our respects was Mrs. Brownstout; the  relict of a field officer who had fallen a victim to jungle fever  several years before, and who was residing in great respectability on  her pension at Barrackpore, as many other widows did and do. She had  lived for some time in England after her husbandâs death, but quitted it  after a time in disgust, finding both climate and people too cold to  suit the warmth of an Indian temperament; her frankness startled folks,  and her unreserved expression of opinion was looked upon, amongst the  worldly-wise, as the evidence of a doubtful sanity.    Of this lady, as one of a class, I must present the reader with a slight  memoir.    Mrs. Brownstout, after the loss of her husband, âher poor dear Browny,â  as she always called him, had nobly set her shoulder to the wheel, and,  with all that admirable perseverance quickened by a lively sense of duty  and parental affection, which the sex (and none more so than Indian  widows) thus circumstanced so often exhibit, had fought a stout battle  for her children; for two sons she had obtained military appointments in  India, having (armed with those potent weapons, the prayers of the widow  and the orphan) laid siege to a good-hearted director, and carried him  by storm, after a feeble show of resistance on his part; and for a third  she had obtained the management of an indigo factory.    Of three daughters, one had married a doctor within hail of the Medical  Board, and Lucinda and Maria were still unmarried, though it was  shrewdly suspected they had no intention to die vestal virgins, if it  could be decently avoided.    Mrs. Major Brownstout was rather dark, and in Abyssinia, where bulk and  beauty are synonymous, would have been considered a remarkably fine  woman; but as it was, she exceeded the English standard of beauty by  some five or six stone.    Fatness and good-humour are almost invariably found united, but which is  the cause and which the effectâwhether fat breeds good-nature or  good-nature fatâis one of those profound mysteries of nature which old  Burton might decide, but for which I have in vain sought a satisfactory  solution.    Mrs. Brownstout was quick, penetrating, and possessed a large fund of  that frankness and kindliness of heart which I have, in the course of my  Eastern experience, almost invariably found to characterize the ladies  of mixed blood in India.    Society full oft, by its folly, oppression, and prejudice, begets the  faults which it affects to hate and despise; and the fact of any classes  being looked down upon, which is more or less the case as regards the  half-caste or Eurasian throughout India (though less so in Bengal than  in the sister presidencies), has a depressing tendency, which naturally  places individuals of that description in a highly disadvantageous  position, deadening the energies, and preventing that free and natural  play and expansion of the mind and feelings which are ever the results  of knowing that we stand well with the world.    In spite, however, of these sinister influences (having the same origin  with those which actuate our American brethren in their conduct to their  coloured countrymen, and which we so loudly condemn), I must bear my  humble testimony in favour of our Eurasian fellow-subjects, who, far  from combining the vices and defects of both races, as has often been  cruelly and flippantly declared, seem, on the contrary, as far as my  experience goes, from griffinage upwards, to unite with the gentleness,  placability, and fidelity of the native many of the sterling virtues of  the European character, though certainly lacking its strength and  energy.    But iron nerves, in which consists the secret of English superiority,  require regulation as well as the weak and more delicate organizations  of the East; for if the one tends to effeminacy, the other, under the  fancied character of manliness, too often tends to ferocity, and that  one-sided freedom called tyranny. âCall this a land of freedom where a  man maynât shoot his own nigger!â said Matthewsâ Yankee; and a volume  could not better express that Irish reciprocity of rights which John and  Jonathan are so prone to patronize.âBut to return.    This engraftment will probably produce those permanent social, moral,  and political fruits, which there from neither European nor native  singly could be expected.    The English greyhound, taken to India, dies, or loses in time most of  his energy and valuable qualities, and the produce decidedly  degenerates; but the cross with the native dog of that species produces  an animal in which is united the Indianized constitution of the one with  much of the speed and courage of the other.    I am sorry to seek an illustration of my position amongst the lower  order of creation, but it perhaps holds good.    We found Mrs. Brownstout in the act of explaining some mystery of dress  to a _dirgee_ (tailor), a little slender ungirdled shrimp, standing,  scissors in hand, amidst a vast accumulation of muslin and ribbon. One  of the young ladies was penning a billet, the other painting flowers.    âHow dâye do, Rattleton, how dâye do?â said the old lady, as we entered,  addressing my friend bluntly, who was evidently one of her âboys.â âI  canât get up to you, you see, so talk to the girls.â    The young ladies, however, arose, and Tom introduced me to them.    On taking my seat they asked me a few common-place questions, such as  how long I had been in India? how I liked it? if I had lately arrived at  Barrackpore? and so forth; to all of which I made suitable replies.    This piece of formality over, the old lady and her daughters, evidently  impatient to unburthen themselves, opened upon Tom _instanter_.    âWell, Rattleton,â said Mrs. B., drily, âwhat have you been doing with  yourself lately? you have become a perfect stranger. Have you brought us  any news? what is doing in cantonments? who is dead and who is wed?â    âI know nothing of buryings or weddings,â said Tom; âtheyâre grave and  melancholy subjects, about which I do not trouble myself.â    âWell, indeed!â retorted Mrs. Brownstout; âI admire that amazingly; we  all consider you one of the greatest gossips of the station.â    âPerhaps, mamma,â said Miss Lucinda, archly, âMr. Rattleton is too much  engaged with his own approaching nuptials to think much about those of  other people.â    âOh, thatâs true,â said Mrs. B., with mock gravity; âthey say you are  going to get married; is it true, Rattleton?â    âOh, nonsense! mere Barrackpore _gup_ and scandal; who could have  told you that?â    âOh, we have had it from the very best authority.â    Tom laughed.    âWell, Mr. Rattleton, when is it to take place?â asked Miss Lucinda,  dipping her brush in her pallet, and touching up her drawing with all  the _nonchalance_ imaginable. âI do so long to know; and who are to be  the bridesmaids? I hope Maria or I shall be admitted to that honour.â    âOh, yes, when I _am_ married, you shall be the bridesmaid, certainly,  the lady consenting; but that event, I take it, is rather remote. What  on earth should a sub like me do with a wife, who can hardly take care  of himself?â    Many a true word spoken in jest, Mr. Tom, thought I.    âYouâll wait for the vacant interpretership, eh?â said the mamma.    âWell, thatâs right, and like a prudent young man.â    âThat is an appointment admirably suited for you, Mr. Rattleton; you  speak the language with such fluency and purity,â observed Miss Lucinda.    âUpon my life,â said Tom, âyouâre a great quiz; how long, Miss Maria, is  it since your sister became so satirical? but as for the language,â  added Tom, a little piqued, âI donât think I speak that badly, after  all. Now I appeal to you, Mrs. Brownstoutâyouâre a judge, and will do me  justice.â    âWhy,â said Mrs. B., âpretty wellâpretty well, considering youâre almost  a griffin.â    âOh, yes, you speak it like a nativeâof England,â added Lucinda,  laughing.    Tom stood this and a good deal more pretty well, being evidently  accustomed to this badinage with the Brownstouts. However, three at once  were too much, and I, being a stranger, was inefficient and dummy.    Tom exhausted his stock of repartee; was âbeat to a dead stand-still,â  to borrow the language of the Ring and began, I thought, to look a  little grave and cross. The ladies, consequently, changed the theme, and  the conversation flowed on in a more equable and rational stream.    At length we arose and took our leave, Mrs. Brownstout begging me to  come with Tom and pass the evening with them whenever I felt so  disposed.    The following day, at eleven, Rattleton and I walked over to the  adjutantâs bungalow. I had had two or three daysâ law and liberty, and  it was intimated to me by Tom that I must now attend to duty, or expose  myself to be considered one of what are cantly denominated âJohn  Companyâs hard bargains.â    The adjutant was a good-looking young man, of five-and-twenty, somewhat  of an exquisite in dress, with large Cossack trousers (then the  fashion), and long brass spurs, which I thought he clanked rather  ostentatiously.    With all this, however (for the exquisite and the soldier are not  incompatible), Adjutant Wigwell was evidently a zealous officer, proud  of his regiment, and devoted to drill and duty; this I had learnt,  indeed, from recent observation and common report.    We found him amidst a bevy of khote havildars (_i.e._ pay-sergeants),  with the sergeant-major, havildar-majorâdeeply engaged in the very  important matter of regulating the length of a pouch-strap, the number  of holes it should have, and the precise position of the buckle, and  trying the fit of the same on a stalwart grenadier of some six feet two.    The sergeant-major, a thick-set Englishman, little more than half the  length and twice the breadth of the gigantic sepoy, was in the act of  adjusting it, with the assistance of the havildar-major, the adjutantâs  native right hand in a sepoy regiment.    Adjutant Wigwell received us kindly, shook me by the hand, and begged us  to be seated and amuse ourselves till he had dismissed the business he  was then attending to, which would not detain him a moment. This being  over, he asked me if I had ever been drilled, and knew any thing of the  manual and platoon, &c.; to which questions I was constrained to reply  in the negative.    âWell,â said he, smiling, âwe must take you in hand a little, and make a  soldier of you. Sergeant-major,â said he, addressing that sturdy little  functionary, standing in the verandah.    âSir,â said the sergeant, touching his hat, and slipping in.    âSergeant Giblett,â continued he, âthis young gentleman, Mr. Gernon, is  doing duty with us; he will soon have to attend all drills and parades;  but, in the meantime, you must give him a little instruction in  marching, and the manual and platoon, with the other young officers  recently arrived to do duty.â    The sergeant again saluted, and said it should be atended to.    âRattleton,â said the adjutant, âyour men fired badly yesterday; how was  that?â    âWhy, I believe it was my fault,â said Tom; âI was nervous, and that  confounded gunpowder, the grains as big as swan-shot, blowing in my face  from the menâs pans, made me more so; however, I must summon my force  next time.â    âDo, my dear fellow,â said the adjutant; âthe colonel noticed it, I  assure you, and desired me in a friendly way just to give you a hint.â    âHeâs a noble fellow,â said Tom, with warmth, âand I love him; I had  rather have my cheeks excoriated, and my eyes damaged in future, than  give him cause of complaint.â    âWell, thatâs all as it should be,â said Wigwell. âRattleton, your  friend Mr. Gernon had better fall in with your company at parade; it may  be pleasant for him, and you, you know,â added he with a smile, âcan  give him the benefit of your experience.â    The next day Tom took me to an unoccupied bungalow, near the lines, used  for various purposes, in order that I might have my first lesson in the  manual and platoon.    We found Sergeant Giblett already there, and talking to several cadets  or ensigns, who seemed much amused, and listening to him attentively.  âAnd that, as near as I can kal-ki-late, was when I first jined the army  under his Excellency Lifttennant Gineral Lord Lakeââwas, however, all we  caught of the yarn.    Rattleton now introduced me to my brother-aspirants for military  gloryâbeardless tyros, wild as unbroken colts, and all agog for fun and  frolic, in whatever shape it might present itself.    âYouâve never had no instruction in the manâil and plytoon, I think you  said, Sir?â said the sergeant to me, touching his hat.    âYouâre quite right; I did say so.â    âWell then, sir, if you please, as itâs the first day, itâll be jist as  well for you to look on.â    âNow, ginâlemen,â said Sergeant-Major Giblett, dismissing at once his  countenance of colloquial familiarity, and assuming the âwrinkled frontâ  of stem duty; ânow, ginâlemen, if you pleaseâweâre a-losing of time, and  had better begin. I think youâre all here, with the hexception of Mr.  Wildman, and he, I am given to onderstand, is ill-disposed this  morning.â    At this speech one of the young hands in the squad winked to his  neighbour, as much as to say, âTwig the sergeantââhe exploded with  laughter; his next file gave him a jerk or dig with his elbowâhe lost  his balance, tumbled against his neighbour, and a general derangement of  the ranks followed.    âCome, ginâlemen, ginâlemen,â said the sergeant, half angry, âthis wonât  doâthis wonât never do; if I am to teach you your manâl and plytoon, you  must be steadyâyou must upon my life. Come, tention,â said he, briskly  squaring up, and throwing open his shoulders, as if determined to  proceed to business. âShoulder! up! Order! up! Onfix bagganets! Thatâs  all right. Shoulder! up! That wonât do, Mr. Cobbold; you must catch her  up sharper than that. Now, please to look at me, sir,â taking the musket  in hand, and doing the thing _secundum artem_.    Another half-smothered laugh again disturbed the little sergeantâs  self-complacency.    âOh! this canât be allowed, ginâlemen. Iâll give it upâIâll give it up,  I will indeed. Iâll report you all to the adjutant, if this here larking  goes on, I will.â    This threat had a sedative effect on the disorderly rank and file, who  now looked wonderfully demure, though with that mock and constrained  gravity which threatened a fresh outbreak on the next elocutionary  attempt of the self-important sergeant.    âNow, ginâlemen, youâll please to observe that, when I says  âShoulder!ââwill you look this way, Mr. Wildgoose, if you please?âwhen I  says âShoulder!â you must each take a firm âgristâ (grasp) of his piece  (a titter)âjust here, about the middle; and when I gives the word âUp!â  you must chuck her up sharp. Now, then. âShoulder!â âGristâ her higher,  Mr. Cobbold. âUp!â Thatâs it.â    âDâân it, Cobbold, take care what youâre at, man,â exclaimed Cobboldâs  left-hand man, on getting a crack on the head from the said Cobboldâs  awkward shouldering.    âOrder! as you were!âWhat are you doing, sir? Thatâs not right. When I  says âAs you were,â I means âAs you was;â that is, as you was  aforeârewerting to your former pisishion. Right about face! Thatâs it.  Now, ginâlemen, when I says âLeft about face,â youâll please to do jist  the same thing, only directly the _contrary_. Steady, ginâlemen, if you  pleaseâsteady! Now march in fileâquick marchâlock-up step!â    âBrown, mind where youâre treading, man.â    âDâân it, I canât help it; _donât_ be so savage.â    âMark time! that is, keep moving without advancing. Halt front! left  backâards wheel! Now, ginâlemen, youâll be pleased to remember that when  I gives the words âQuick march!â youâll fall backâards on the pivot  manâthat is to say, on the wheeling pintâall one as a gate on its  âinges. Quick march! thatâs it, ginâlemenâthatâs it.â    In this style the good-humoured but consequential little sergeant was  wont to instruct us in the rudimental part of the glorious art of war.    On breaking off and dismissing the awkward squad the young men composing  it assembled round Sergeant Giblett, who appeared to be a prime  favourite amongst them, and he on his part was evidently so much pleased  with them, that it was obviously with difficulty that his good-nature  allowed him to maintain that dignity which he evidently felt, and which  ought to be the inseparable concomitant of command.    âWell, sergeant, how did I do to-day?â    âWhy, sir,â said Giblett, âitâs not my wish to flatter no ginâleman, but  you have sartainly improved in your marchings.â    âAnd me, sergeant,â said another, âhow do I get on?â    âWhy, sir, youâll soon be all right, if you pays a little more  attention.â    âI say, sergeant, what makes you call the musket âshe?ââ    âWhy, you know, sir, the firelock among âRopeyarn[27] sogers (itâs  different, of coorse, among the Seapies[28]) alwâs goes by the  denomy-nation of Brown Bess, and so we calls it âshe.ââ    âOh, thatâs it, is it, sergeant?â    âTake a glass of grog, Giblett, after your fatigues?â    âThankye, sir, I donât care if I do.â    âHere, you bearer, black fellow,â said the donor, â_brandy_, _shrub_,  _pawney_, _sergeant_, _ko do_â (_i.e._, give the sergeant some  brandy-and-water).    Sergeant Giblett took the empty glass, extended his arm in one direction  to have it filled, whilst he turned his head in another; bearer applies  his teeth to the brandy-bottle to get the cork out.    âYou were a-axing of me, sir, I think, about the cellybrated battle of  Laswarrie, in which weâthat is, the ridgâment I then belonged toâwas  present, under Lifttennant Gineral Lord Lake; yes, that was pretty near  the stiffest business we had. There was the battalions of the French  gineral, Munseer Donothing (Duderneg): and very good troops they was,  though not so good as our Seapies. Hulloa!â he exclaimed, breaking off  in his story, and looking towards the tumbler, which the bearer was busy  in filling, âwhatâs this here man about?âheâs a-givin me all the bottle  of brandy; here come, you must put some of this back.â    âNo, noânonsense, sergeant,â said the liberal donor, âdrink it allâit  wonât hurt you.â    This was just what Sergeant Giblett wanted.    âWell, thankye, sir; but Iâm afraid its over strong. Ginâlemen, hereâs  towards your very good healths.â    So saying, Giblett drained off the dark potationâa regular  ânorth-westerââset down the empty glass, and took his leave, reserving  his âyarnâ for another time.                                       CHAPTER XVII.      Under the able tuition of Sergeant Giblett I became, in a few days,  sufficiently a proficient in the mysteries of marching, &c., to allow of  my falling in with Lieut. Rattletonâs company, the left grenadiers,[29]  and it was consequently arranged, with the concurrence of the adjutant,  that I should make my _dÃ©but_ on parade when next the battalion was out  for exercise.    On the day previous to that event taking place, after tiffin, a sepoy  orderly brought in the regimental and station orders; and Tom, after  reading them, directed my attention particularly to a paragraph in the  former, which ran thus:    âThe regiment will parade for exercise to-morrow morning, at a quarter  after gun-fire, furnished with ten rounds of blank cartridge per man.â    âThere! my sub,â said Rattleton; âto-morrow you will see a little  service, and smell gunpowder for the first time in your life.â    âYouâre wrong there,â said I; âyou seem to have forgotten my recent  engagement with the Dacoits; why sir,â said I, affecting to bristle up,  âthough you do command a company I have seen far more active service  than you have. A siegeâa pursuitâa routâand a retreat, are pretty well,  I take it, for an ensign of two monthsâ standing.â    âHa! ha! Well, thatâs true, to be sure,â rejoined my friend, laughing;  âyou have, indeed, seen balls fired with intent to do grievous bodily  harm, and against the peace of our sovereign lord the kingâbut I would  sink the _bolt_, Frank, when I talked of my Junglesoor exploits. But,  seriously, you must get all your military trappings ready overnight, and  Iâll see that you are called in good time in the morning.â    I retired to bed rather earlier than usual, oppressed with a most  unpleasantly alarmed state of feelings, something akin, probably, to  that which a man experiences the night before he is hangedâor has to  fight a duelâor to encounter any other disagreeable novelty. I wished  the initiatory process fairly over, having somehow or other allowed my  anxiety to work on my imagination till I pictured it as something very  formidable.    I was aroused, next morning, by Rattletonâs singing, with reference to  my dormant state, I suppose, âArise, arise! Britanniaâs sons, arise,â  and by a rough shake of the shoulder.    âEh! what?âwhatâs the matter?â said I, starting up, rubbing my eyes, and  yawning.    âCome, my sub, jump up, jump up! parade! parade! the gun has fired.â    âWhy, itâs pitch dark, Tom,â said I, still stretching; âyou surely donât  go to parade in the middle of the night?â    Tom assured me it was the proper hour, and that it would soon be light;  his bearer ran in at the same moment, open-mouthed, to say the colonel  was on horseback and had just ridden past.    This announcement quickened my movements; so I reluctantly jumped out of  my warm nest, and, after a miserable cold dabble, dressed myself by the  light of a candle, âin the lantern dimly burning,â buckled on my Andrea  Ferrara, brushed up my hair, took a peep in the glass, to see how I  looked on an average, and then, _grande tenue_, and arm-in-arm, marched  off to parade with my friend.    âThe day, you see, is beginning to break,â said he.    âI wish, with all my heart, it would make haste about it,â I returned  (âand I think I do see a few ruddy streaks in the east), for this is a  heathenish hour, a most Cimmerian gloom to manÅuvre in. For my part, I  am sure I could not distinguish a rank of soldiers from a brick wall.â    âYou will soon become accustomed to it,â answered my commandant, âand  find the reasonableness of this and other Indian customs, which now  appear singular to you; better to be comfortable in darkness than to  grill in broad day.â    âTom,â said I, âyou must tell me where I am to stand, and what I am to  do, for I know no more than the man in the moon.â    âYouâll have merely to march in the rear of the company,â said my  commander; âkeep step, and salute in passing in review; all that, I  think you understand.â    As we passed through the sepoy lines, and approached the parade, the men  were just in the act of falling in, and my ears were saluted by a  strange and confused hubbub, loud shouts, and words of command in odd  voices.    There was the â_Hall dreez_â (halt dress), â_Lupt buccas wheel_â (left  backwards wheel), and â_Qeeck marruch_â (quick march), of the native  officers (by whom one-half of the platoons, at least, were commanded),  and the same, though in more intelligible English, in the sharper tones  of the Europeans.    Then there was a rattling of muskets, and a ringing of ramrods; the loud  voice of the commandant; the clattering of the adjutantâs steel  scabbard, and the ringing of his horseâs hoofs, as he thundered down the  ranks in a prodigious fussâwhy, I could not tellâunless to create a  sensation. Our adjutant, however, of the Zubberdust Bullumteers, was a  prodigiously smart officer, and always galloped three times as fast as  was necessary.    It was all exciting and strange to me, to find myself thus, for the  first time, about to participate in real military proceedings; the  actual game of soldiers, which I had hitherto only viewed, with becoming  awe, _Ã  la distance_, or mimicked, as a younker, with penny drum and  falchion of tin. I was now about to realize one of my dreams of boyhood.    Timeâs misty veil has long rested on those days, but still I can recal  the stirring interest I used to experience when the recruiting-sergeant,  on a fair-day, marched through our village. I think I now behold him,  with his drawn sword and flying ribbons, proud as a turkey-cock, with  all the tag-rag and bobtail at his heels.    What a glorious thing I thought it was to be a soldierâa real,  downright, actual soldierâto wear a red coat, and fight the French! How  I longed to be the fifer, or even the little duck-legged drummer, as he  strode valiantly through the mud, with his long gaitersâvery little  older than myself, too, and yet privileged to wear a _real_ sword! Even  the gawky smock-frock clowns, won by the sergeantâs eloquence, touching  the joys of a soldierâs life, and forming a part of the tail of this  flaming meteor, came in for a share of my envy.    âAh!â I used mentally to exclaim, âIâll certainly be a soldier when I am  a man!â Here, then, was the realization; a downright _bonÃ¢ fide_  regiment, real guns, real colonel, and all, and I a constituent portion  of itâin a word, an officer! Thus, my gratification, in a great measure,  overcame my uneasiness.    âThe battalion will pass in reviewâmarch!â roared the colonel; and away  we went, as solemn as mutes at a funeral, I behind my sepoys,âsword  drawn, stiff as the little man in the Lord Mayorâs carriage, right leg  foremost. It was an agitating moment, and I in a nervous tremour, lest I  should commit some blunder. We turned the angle of the square,âthe band  struck up,âand we approached the saluting flag.    âRear rank, take open order!â    The native officers made a long leg; I did the same, and found myself in  front of the company, exposed to general notice. To use a coarse, but  expressive phrase, I was in a âdevil of a stew.â    I kept a close eye on my captain, however, thinking, if I did as he did  I could not be wrong.    We approached the colonel; I saw he had his eye upon me. Ye powers, if  such there be, who preside over steps short and long, and all others the  deep mysteries of drill and parade, how much did I then need your aid!  What mighty effort did I make to keep step.    Within saluting distance, Tom brought up his sword; I did the same; but,  looking forward, omitted to bring it down again, till a cough from Tom,  and an â_Isee, Sahib!_â (thus, sir,) from the half-laughing old subadar,  caused me quickly to rectify the little omission.    Well, we formed close and open column, solid squares, and squares to  receive cavalry, and I know not what on earth besides: there was a  fearful drumming, firing, and charging, and I was half-stupefied with  the noise and rapid ravelling and unravelling, embodyings and  dispersings of this animated Chinese puzzle. However, I stuck close to  the rear of my sepoys, and bore up through it wonderfully well upon the  whole.    How astonished our descendants, some three or four centuries hence, will  be, methinks, when man shall have become one consolidated mass of  intellect and morality, as they ponder over our ingenious modes of  effecting wholesale extermination! âThus,â they will exclaim, perhaps,  as they sigh over the aberrations and follies of their barbarous  ancestors, ââtwas thus they shot, slashed, and impaled one another; in  this way they attacked and defended; and thus they invested the  machinery of destruction with all the pomp of music, the glitter of  ornament, and the splendour of decoration.â    Some, however (distinguished historians and pious Christians too),  strangely enough, take a very different view of the matterâmaintaining  that war is an inherent adjunct of the social stateâthat without it we  should become utterly enervatedâsink into stagnation, and that, in  short, there can be no healthy action without mutual destruction! that  it exists at all is puzzlingâbut that, it must ever be is both  mortifying and astounding. Between, however, man viewed as a mere  animal, and man considered as an intellectual and moral being, those who  hope for perfection and those who despair of it,âQuaker endurance, that  bears to be spat upon, and morbid honour, that fires at a look;âbetween,  I say, all these conflicting views and practicesâthese cross lights and  opposite principlesâmany honest thinkers are sorely puzzled to make up  their minds on the subjectâas to whether combativeness is, or is not, an  inherent element of our nature, which must as necessarily break out into  a conflict occasionally, as the atmosphere brews the tempestâor whether  war be not destined to swell the category of past follies, witchcraft,  persecutions, astrology, and the like; and to this view I for one  honestly incline.    The press and steam, right mental cultureâproper social organization and  international co-operation, may do wonders; so long, however, as war  continues to be the â_ultima ratio regum_,â the arbiter, for want of a  better, of national differences, let all honour be shown to those who,  in wielding its powers, display, as British soldiers do, some of the  noblest qualities of our nature, and who, though yielding to the  necessity of shedding blood, still love to temper courage with humanity,  and to mitigate its inherent evils.    At length, as all things must, our exercise came to an end. The parade  was dismissed. The officers, European and native, fell out on dismissing  their companies and advanced towards the commandant, who, as is  customary, waited in front to receive them.    Having saluted, and returned their swords to their scabbards, there was  a general unbending, and the laugh and the joke and the news went round.    âWell, Rantipole, how does the grey carry you? What did you give for  him?â    âTwo hundred and fifty dibsâ (_i.e._, rupees); âwouldnât take four  hundred for him at this moment.â    âIsnât he a little puffed in that off fore-leg?â said Captain Syphax,  drily.    âNo, not that I know of.â    âWho was at Mrs. Roundaboutâs hop last night? they say that old  Crosslight, the brigade major, was more than ordinarily attentive to the  widow.â    âOh! I didnât hear thatâby the way, Tom, when does your affair come on?â    âNonsense! how do I know?â    âHear him; hear him! hear the Benedict!â    âRantipole, Iâll bet you five gold mohurs,â said one of the subs, âthat  my old Toorkie beats your new purchase once round the course, P. P.â    âDone! but I donât sport gold mohurs; say five chicks,[30] and itâs a  bet; or I donât mind if I make it ten.â    âChicks, Tom,â said I, aside; âisnât it rather an odd thing to bet fowls  on a horse race? this is another of your Indian customs, I suppose, the  reasonableness of which is not apparent at a glance.â    Tom stamped and laughed at my query, like a madman, to the astonishment  of all present.    âHere,â said he, in a whisper, and pulling me aside âyou great griff  you! chicks are sequins, or chequins abbreviated to chicks;ânot fowls,  as you imagine: have you never heard that before?â    âNever,â said I.    âWhatâs the joke, Rattleton, whatâs the joke?â said the colonel,  good-humouredly; âcome, letâs have it, and donât keep it all to  yourself.â    âOh, nothing, sir, nothing particular, sir,â said Tom; ânothing, but  rather a griffinish query of my friend Gernonâs, which tickled me a  little.â    âI am afraid you are rather too hard upon him,â said, the colonel;  âremember, Rattleton, I could tell a few stories of griffins if I  chose.â    Tom felt the rebuke, and had the laugh turned against him.    The colonel now addressed me, and, in a very kind and encouraging  manner, eulogized the way in which I had acquitted myself on my first  appearance in public, adding, âI hope we shall send you to your regiment  up the country quite a proficient, and calculated to reflect credit on  your instructors in the Zubberdust Bullumteers.â    As our worthy commandant was anxious that I should have an insight into  the various branches of military duty, the adjutant was desired to make  me attend regimental courts-martial, invaliding committees, guard  mountings, &c., that I might see how these duties were carried on.    The first court-martial I attended was a regimental one for the trial of  a black drummer for theft.    Tom took me to the bungalow of the superintending officer, who is always  an European, and whose duty it is to conduct the proceedings which he  records, assisted by the regimental interpreter, who is also the  quarter-master of the regiment.    Shortly after our arrival, the native officers composing the court made  their appearance; they were all large, portly men, singular compounds of  those moral antipodes, the European and the Asiatic.    Instead of the black military stock of the English officer, they wore,  over white cotton collars, necklaces of gold, formed of massive embossed  beads, each almost as large as a small bean or nutmeg; the overalls of  the majority had been pulled up over the _Dotee_, or waistcloth, a  Hindoo article of dress, containing almost cloth enough to serve for the  envelopment of a mummy.    [Illustration: The Native Court-martial.]    This swathing of the loins, gathered into a bunch behind and before,  renders a considerable amplitude of waistband indispensably necessary,  and causes, moreover, very often an unseemly protuberance under the  jacket flaps on the hinder regions, ornamental, no doubt, in a dromedary  or Hottentot Venus, though any thing but improving to the appearance of  a military man.    In spite, however, of these little drawbacks, or, perhaps, I should say  humpbacks, there was much in the general appearance of these Indian  veterans which to me, as a novice, and not altogether an unobservant  one, was exceedingly striking and interesting, not having yet had an  opportunity of observing them so leisurely; to those, however,  accustomed to see them daily, these feelings doubtless had long since  died away.    Two or three were aged men, whose snowy whiskers and mustachios  contrasted strikingly with the swarthy hue of their well-chiselled and  manly countenances; gold and silver medals hung on their breasts,  mementoes of past services under a Wellesley, a Coote, a Baird, a  Harris, a Lake, or some other of the many commanders who have led the  brave and faithful sepoy, whereâer in this hemisphere Britain has had a  cause to maintain, and whose deeds are chronicled in some of the  brightest pages of Indian military history.    âHow is it, Tom,â said I, âthat the European officers, who have shared  in the same dangers, and who have fought in the same fields, exiles from  home and kindred, and grilling under your fiery sun here, are not also  honoured with medals for remarkable services?â[31]    âUpon my life, Frank, I canât tell you; it is one of those profound  mysteries which it does not become unassisted reason to probe too  closely: there must be some latent policy in it, though it is far beyond  the ken of ordinary mortals. My old native officer, Subadar Davy  Persaud, one day, in my presence, asked your friend Captain Marpeet,  when lounging at my bungalow, what was the reason of it? âWe are  puzzled, Sahib,â said he, âto make it out; they are either of no value,  and given to us, as baubles are to the _Baba Logue_ (children), or else  you gentlemen, who led us on, and shared in our dangers and hardships,  are very ill-treated by the Kumpany Ungruis Bahadour, in not being  allowed to share in the distinction, which we should prize much more if  our officers did share it.ââ    âThat seems like a poser,â said I.    âIt does,â replied Tom; ââtis plausible; but it just shows into what  errors mere unassisted reason may lead us.â    âBut what said Marpeet to it? he is a right loyal man, and always sticks  up for the âHonourable John.ââ    âWhy,â said Tom, âCaptain Marpeet, being a bit of a logician, proved  syllogistically to old Davy Persaud that all was as it should be, thus:  âIt was well known,â said he, âand an established fact, that the  Honourable Company are liberal, generous and considerate masters; that  they donât do illiberal, impolitic, and inconsiderate thingsâ_ergo_,â  and there Marpeet brought his conclusions to bear in high style, and  regularly demolished David Persaudâs position; â_ergo_, this must be all  right, though appearances are the other way.â Your friend, however,  confessed to me afterwards, that when at home he should have been glad  could he have sported a bit of ribbon at his button hole, or something  of the sort, just to show that he had frozen patriotically on the  mountains of Nepaul, and struck a blow for old England at Laswarrie and  Putpergunge.â    I was much surprised, and not a little amused, to observe that each  native officer was accompanied by an attendant, generally some simple  looking Coolie youth, carrying his chair, and odd three-cornered pieces  of furniture some of them were.    âTom,â said I, _sotto voce_, âthere seems to be no want of chairmen at  your meeting; but, seriously, tell me, is it usual for the native  officers to carry about their chairs in this sort of way?â    My friend answered that it generally was, and that not only native, but  European officers did the like, subalternsâ bungalows not being usually  overstocked with furniture.    âThe possession of a chair, by the way, and the right to sit in it in  the presence of his European officer,â added he, âare prerogatives on  which the subadur or jemadar sets a high value.â    âEnlighten my griffinism a little, Tom,â said I, âand expound the cause  thereof.â    âWhy, the reason,â rejoined my friend, âis, I believe, this. No inferior  in India ever sits in the presence of a superior, unless squatting on  his heels on the ground may be so considered; and you must have  perceived that a chair is never offered to a sepoy or non-commissioned  native officer, under any circumstance of long detention or the like,  which it would perhaps be to Europeans of the same rank in those cases;  in fact, if it were, it would be stoutly refused, and the man would  think you were bantering him. But when promoted, when he gets his  commission, he acquires a _status_ in society, is an â_uppiser_â (an  officer), one of the _sirdar logue_, and in some respects on a par with  his European superior. He now sports a gold necklace or _kanta_; and  sets up a chair and a tatoo (pony), as indispensable concomitants of his  newly-acquired rankâriding on the one, and in all probability sitting on  the other, for the first time in his life. I have been a good deal  amused,â continued Tom, âto see them sometimes, when seated opposite  their houses, or rather huts, in the lines, enjoying their _otium cum  dignitate_ in these same chairs, illustrating amusingly enough the  invincible force of habitâlegs partly doubled up under them, feet  slantingly projecting under the arms thereof, instead of depending  before, according to the usages of Christendom. Blacky does not readily  adopt new habits and European improvements; or if he does, he often mars  their object by engrafting on them something of his own.â    âI dare say,â said I, âfrom what I have seen, that this is true enough.â    âA gentleman up the country, for example,â continued Tom, âsome time  ago, wished to introduce the use of the wheelbarrow into his garden,  with other English improvements; when next he went there, he found the  coolie, or gardenerâs assistant, to his astonishment, carrying the  wheelbarrow on his head, with a load of gravel. Why, a week ago, I gave  my vagabond _bawurchee_ (cook), whom, you know, I sent to the right  about yesterday, a tin flour dredger, that I might be spared the  mortification of having my food unnecessarily manipulated. The very next  time I went to the _bawurchee khana_ (cook house), I caught the villain  taking the flour in pinches out of the perforated head of my dredger (as  one would take a pinch out of a snuff-box) and sprinkling it over the  cutlet. Ah! I fear that nature designed natives and jackasses to be  managed by the cudgel!â    âWhy, that is Captain Marpeetâs principle to a T,â said I. âSound  thrashings, according to him, with some races, are meant to answer the  purpose of sound reasonings with others; it requires caution, however,  in applying that principle. For example, it would be far from safe to  try it on some of those big-calved fellows one sees behind the coaches  at home,âeh, Tom?â    âYouâre right, Frankâyouâre right; I see the drift of your remark. It  does seem unmanly to thrash those who cannot and will not retaliate. But  theyâre confoundly stupid and provoking; and your crouching spaniel  always invites a kick.â    By the time we had terminated our âaside,â the native officers had  saluted, and after some little fuss and rattling of their huge sabres,  had settled down into a quiescent state, each man in his own proper  chair, and wearing his hat _cum privilegio_ as bravely as my Lord  Kinsale himself.    The superintending officer, a smart young Light Bob, was in readiness  with his recording apparatusâhis foolscap, and his pen and ink. The  interpreter opened his book, containing the forms of oath to be  administered to the assembled Christians, Mahomedans, and Hindoos, all  cordially united to administer the common right of every creed and  colourâjustice.    The black-bearded Moolah stood by with the _Koran_, wrapped in many a  fold of linen, to guard it from the polluting touch or look of the  infidel, whilst the regimental brahmin, his forehead marked with bars of  ochre and pigment, indicative of his sanctity, was also in attendance,  holding in his hands a brazen vessel, filled with the _Gunja jhull_, or  Ganges water, in which was immersed a sprig of (as I was told) the  sacred _toolsie_. On these two symbols, or foundations of their  respective faiths, the Mussulmans and Hindoos are sworn.    The superintending officer now directed the prisoner to be brought in,  and an orderly sepoy immediately called out â_Aundo Bridgemaum!_â    âWhat does he mean by that?â I inquired.    âHe means,â said Tom, ââbring in the prisoner,â _bridgemaum_ being the  native way invariably of pronouncing the English word âprisoner.ââ    The first native sworn was Rustum Khan, an old Mahomedan subadar.    After saluting with deep respect the volume of his faith, he received it  from the Moolah on the palms of his hands, holding it thus, with a look  of profound veneration, whilst the regimental interpreter recited the  form of the oath, which he repeated after him.    The Hindoos, received the vessel containing the Ganges water in their  hands, and were sworn to judge impartially in like manner.    The trial now began.    The prisoner, a poor little black devil of a drummer, was asked by the  interpreter if he was guilty, or not guilty; to which he replied â_Jo up  ka kooshee_â as interpreted by Tom, âwhichever my lord pleases.â    This _naÃ¯ve_ reply made the superintending officer relax his judicial  gravity. The interpreter also smiled.    The stolid old subadars, however, could perceive nought but stupidity in  it, evidently, and one of them angrily said to the prisoner, â_Guddah_  (ass), say one or the other.â    Being, with the exception of a few words, wholly ignorant of the  language, I could not, of course, follow the examination. The reader  may, however, rest assured that he has not, in consequence, lost any  information which it would be of much consequence for him to obtain.    The superintending officer and interpreter seemed to have it all their  own way, rebuking crude judgments and irrelevent questions, &c. (just as  a judge bothers a stupid jury); laying down the law to the subadars and  jemadars, who nodded like Chinese mandarins, in deep acquiescence to  their superior wisdom, saying â_such bhat_ and _bhote khoob_.â[32]    The native officer, before coming into the Court, has generally (_i.e._,  in five cases out of six) made up his mind after a long _bhat cheet_  (chat, or discussion, as to the guilt or innocence of the party),  touching both the act and its criminality; but is guided in his verdict  or decision, nevertheless, pretty much by what the European officers may  say to him: his own peculiar notions of justice and good evidence are,  perhaps, clear enough; but, confused by European refinements, the  sublimity of which his untutored mind cannot reach, he yields himself  passively to be guided by the _dicta_ of the _Sahib Logue_.    Upon the whole, when the Court was cleared, and Tom and I repaired to  his bungalow, I felt that I had added something to my little stock of  experience, in having witnessed this mode of administering _justice_ in  a sepoy corps.    The next thing of the kind I attended was an invaliding committee, a  body assembled periodically for the purpose of examining those soldiers  whose age or infirmities rendered them unfit for further active service,  which I need not describe.    The system of granting pensions to old and worn-out veterans is an  admirable one; it binds the native soldier to us more strongly than  anything else, and is one of the firmest foundations of our power in  India. Frequently, at a more advanced period of my Indian career, have I  had occasion to observe its admirable workings. I have listened to the  old veteran, in his native village, with pleasure, surrounded by his  children, and childrenâs children, as he has recounted his deeds, showed  his medals and his scars, and spoken with, I believe, sincerely grateful  feelings of the generosity of the âKumpany Angraiz Bahadour.â                                       CHAPTER XVIII.      A day or two after this, my bearer gave me a little rose-coloured  billet, which had been left for me, of which missives (though not always  _couleur de rose_) there is a vast circulation in Indiaâalmost all  communications from house to house, and family to family, being carried  on in this way.    The note was from Miss Lucinda; it was written in a delicate crow-quill  hand, and sealed with a dainty device (â_qui me nÃ©glige, me perd_â), or  something of that sort, and contained an invitation, in her mammaâs  name, to a _soirÃ©e musicale_, on the following evening.    âHere is an invitation (a provoke), Tomâ said I, âfrom your friend, the  stout gentlewoman; shall we go?â    âOh, certainly,â was the reply. âI have a similar one. Mrs. Brownstoutâs  parties are amongst the most agreeable at Barrackpore; her guests are  always well selected and well assortedâthe grand _desiderata_ of all  social meetings. I like her and her daughters amazingly, having  uniformly received the most unaffected kindness from both. The old lady,  indeed, looks upon me as her son, and, if there were not insuperable  obstacles in the way, Frank,â_entendez-vous?_âI might become so in  reality.â    âPerhaps, Tom,â said I, âthatâs what she is manÅuvering to effect.â    âNo,â replied he; âshe is above-board, and incapable of such a  proceeding; she is no schemerâwould be glad, no doubt, to marry her  girls to worthy men, in an open, honest way; but would scorn to effect  it by little crooked arts: never, Frank, if you please, say a word to  the prejudice of Mrs. Brownstout in my presence.â    âWhy, Tom,â said I, astonished, âwhatâs the matter with you? Youâre  warm, my dear fellow; I meant no offence to you, and as forââ    âSay no more, say no more,â said Tom, stopping my mouth; âyou were  jesting, and I was hasty; but I cannot bear the shadow of an imputation  on those I regard. If any one said a word against you, Frank, Iâd floor  him.â    I was touched by my friendâs generous warmth. âYouâre a worthy fellow,  Tom,â said I, squeezing his hand; âbut pray heaven we may be spared the  necessity of showing our love for one another in that way, though we  have battled pretty often in each otherâs defence in times past. Do you  remember, by-the-bye, the joint-stock pummelling we gave Jack Grice, the  cobbler, when at old Thwackumâs?â    âHa! ha! I do, indeed, Frank; the fellow thought he had us out of  school, and in a _cul de sac_; but he caught a brace of Tartars.â    At the appointed hour, the next evening, we found ourselves at Mrs.  Brownstoutâs bungalow. From the number of palankeens and return buggies  we met, on our entering the domain, or compound, we were led to infer  that the party was pretty numerous, which proved to be the case.    Having deposited our hats in the hall or verandah, which, by the way,  was full of hookhas of various degrees of splendourâa luxury then more  indulged in than at presentâwe entered the well-lighted saloon, or  reception room; and I confess I was agreeably surprised at the elegance  and propriety of the _tout ensemble_.    It is a pleasant sight, in a distant land, thus to meet a social  assembly of your countrymen and women, young and old, enjoying music and  conversation, and the pleasing refinements of the Western world.    A group of Barrackpore belles occupied one portion of the apartmentâa  gay parterreâin which, however, the sun flower and the lily greatly  predominated over the rose.    In front of them, and standing in groups here and there, were numerous  officers of the different regiments at the station, fine, handsome young  fellows, for the most part, in the bloom of life, on whom the sword, and  time, and care, and the airs of the death-concocting jungles, had yet to  do their work. There they were, laughing the light laugh of the careless  heart, and doing and saying all those things, the exact counterpart of  which, perhaps, had been said and done in that very bungalow by many a  set as jocund as they, who had gone before them, had run their brief  Indian career, died, and been forgotten.    Then, as a sort of counterpoise to the youth of the party, were certain  portly colonels and majors, button-holding in corners over grave  discussions of off-reckonings, changes of stations, &c., their goodly  and well-matured persons contrasting with those of the slender youths  aroundâas do the gnarled and bulky oaks of many a winter, with the tall  and slender saplings of the forest.    Then there was a jovial old surgeon from the north of the Tweed, who  took snuff out of a mull, and cracked the driest of jokes in the  crabbedest of tongues; and two or three _distinguÃ©_-looking civilians,  temporary visitants to Barrackpore, exhibiting, in the studied  simplicity of their attire and well-tied cravats, a striking contrast to  the gay uniforms of the militaryâwho, poor fellows, too often illustrate  the proverb, that âall is not gold that glitters;â and hence, indeed,  the civilian consoles himself for wanting it on his coat, by the  comfortable consideration that he has _quantum suff._ of it in his  pocket.    Particularly conspicuous amongst the company assembled at Mrs.  Brownstoutâs, was a jocose old collector, the life and soul of the  party, who, being remarkably ill-favoured, and very good-natured, seemed  to feel himself privileged, without danger of misconstruction, to be  wondrously facetious with the young ladies, whom he roundly declared  were all in love with him, and gave him no rest or peace with their  incessant attentions.    âThere now you see, there it is,â said he, starting pettishly away, and  looking piteously and appealingly to the company, as Miss Maria touched  his elbow, and asked him to take some tea; âthere it is again; you see  she wonât let me alone.â    I learnt afterwards that he had been an old friend of the deceased  major, with whom he had hunted and shot, and drank pale ale, on and off,  for five-and-twenty years; that he was, moreover, Mariaâs godfather, and  the true friend of the family, by whom he was consulted on all weighty  and important matters. Though a systematic drole or humourist, he was at  bottom a man of sound judgment and extensive knowledge, and the most  benevolent of human kind.    Shortly after we had entered, Mrs. Brownstout met us with a greeting  which amply made up in cordiality for whatever it might want in  refinement, and from Maria and Lucinda we received kind nods of  recognition, though too busy to do more. There they were in all their  bravery, doing the honours of the tea-table, exhibiting the albums and  the caricatures, and endeavouring to make every one at home and  happyâcheerful within the limits of propriety and good sense, attentive  to all, with kindness and the most obliging tact.    âYouâre right, Tom,â said I, âin your estimate of this family; the  mother is, though a little blunt, a worthy woman, and the girls are  dear, sweet creatures; I declare Iâve a good mind to marry them both.â    âBoth! Are you quite sure that either of them would have you?â    âBut Tom, by the way,â I continued, âto change the subject from my loves  to yours, is not that Miss Julia Heartwell?â directing, at the same  time, his attention towards that young lady, who hitherto, from her  position, had escaped our observation: âhow lovely she looks this  evening, with her tiara of white roses!â    Tom coloured: âSo it is,â he replied; âI did not expect to meet her  here.â    So saying, and after a pause to muster courage, Ensign Rattleton moved  across the room; a fine, well-made, broad-shouldered young fellow he was  too, and in his tight, well-fitting raggie, or Swiss jacket (one of the  neatest turnouts of Messrs. Gibson and Pawling), his small and  gracefully-tied sash, his white Cossack trousers, and grenadier wings  (of which he was especially proud), it would have been difficult to  conceive a more elegant figure, or one in which youth, strength, and  symmetry were more happily blended.    Tom evidently did not wish to appear marked and particular, or to excite  more observation than could be well avoided; he consequently made his  approaches very gradually, speaking to some other young ladies of his  acquaintance in the group before he addressed the _objet aimÃ©e_.    I marked the pretty Julia, who, though doubtless aware of the motive,  bit her lip, and seemed ill to bear even this assumed indifference. True  love is a brittle affair, and, like a box of china, must be managed  âwith caution.â    Tom, however, at length approached; many a curious eye was upon them,  and now, ârebel natureâ unfurled her crimson flag, and the little god of  love beat his rat-tat-too; in other words, the conscious blush  overspread the lovely Juliaâs countenance, and the palpitations of her  bosom told full plainly all that was passing in the little heart  beneath.    Ensign Rattleton, with an attempt at unconcern, presented his hand, and  a seat being unoccupied by her side, he rather awkwardly (for he was not  himself) slid into it.    Poor Tom! his efforts at composure, marred by the consciousness that he  was the object of observationâhis blushes and her tell-tale looks of  mingled tenderness and admiration, were all too palpable to escape  notice.    âIts all up with him,â said the caustic old bachelor captain whom I had  met at the colonelâs, giving me a slight touch with his elbow; âas dead  a case of splice as I ever saw in my lifeâwell, humph!âbetter let it  alone, and remain as he is. Heâll think so too when the _butchas_  (children) and the bills come tumbling in together by-and-by.â    Lucinda now, at the desire of some of the company, gave us some charming  airs to the accompaniment of the guitar, which she touched with peculiar  grace; Maria afterwards warbled to the piano, and finally, by particular  desire, sung a lively native song, the burthen of which was â_Hilly  milly puniya_,â the great delight of the old collector, who stood over  her, shaking his head, beating time with his hands, as if quite at home  in the matter, and occasionally footing it in a mincing burlesque way,  which I was afterwards told was a jocular imitation of the Indian nautch  girls, with whom this song is a favourite; it constituting one of that  mellifluous variety, with which I have often since heard them âstartle  the dull ear of night.â    A good deal of merriment was caused by the collectorâs animated  earnestness, and the young hands cried â_encore!_â One of his friends,  an old colonel, present, exclaimed,    âWhy, you nautch superbly, Dilkhoob (for that was his name); I did not  expect such activity at your time of life.â    âAh! donât Iâdonât I?â said the merry old gentleman. âBut what do you  mean, sir, by my time of life? five-and-twenty only last birthday! We  young fellows must be always in actionâalways in action.â    âYou both play and sing, do you not, Miss Heartwell?â said Maria,  addressing herself to Julia.    Julia, of course, said âvery little,â that she hardly ever played,  âexcepting at home;â and that, moreover, she was just then haunted by  the vocalistâs malific genius, a cold.    The facetious collector now seated himself near a very lovely young  woman, who, I learnt from Tom, was the adjutantâs lady; a pleasant  _tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte_ followed; the lady seemed highly amused; the adjutant  himself, who was a friend of Dilkhoob, soon joined them.    âWell, sir, here you find me,â said the old gentleman, âflirting with  your wife. Sir, I love your wife.â The adjutant smiled (it was almost a  _mauvaise plaisanterie_). âYes, Iâve a right to love her, sir; Iâm not  forbidden to love her as long as I donât covet her; and so I will love  her, sir.â    The gentlemen laughedâthe ladies looked into their fansâbut it was only  honest Dilkhoob, the privileged man.    Miss Heartwell now sat down to sing, Tom, in the most exemplary and  obsequious manner, selecting her book and turning over the leaves.    Julia then drew off, deliberately, first from one hand and then from the  other, her silk gloves, of a texture almost as light and delicate as  gossamer or a spiderâs web (which she placed on the piano), displaying  two of the whitest, softest, and most beautifully turned little hands  that I think I ever beheld; I doubt if Sir Roger de Coverleyâs widowâs  could have equalled them.    Having run these delicate fingersâlike a bevy of white miceârapidly over  the keys, as if to ascertain the force and tone of the instrument, she  paused, looked up, and, with a sort of girlish waywardness, said,â    âWell, now, what am I to sing?â    Tom, with infinite obsequiousness, pointed with his finger to an air he  had selectedâit was Mooreâs exquisite song, âThose Evening Bells,â a  song which will endure as long as man retains a right perception of the  touching and the beautiful, and which expresses, in the happiest  language, what thousands have felt, when that inexplicably sad and sadly  pleasing music, the chime of distant bells floating softly over hill and  dale, falls on the listening ear.    Sweet bard of Erin! embodier of our tenderest thoughtsâtranslator of our  dumb emotionsâfixer of those painted bubbles of the soul which before  thee burst at the touch of wordsâhow many exiles have thy glorious songs  made glad! how many solitudes have they cheered! how many pensive  spirits have they soothed and delighted! how oft have thy soul-breathed  words, sung to the strains of old, and falling on the finest chords of  the heart, awakened all its noblest responses, to liberty, patriotism,  love and glory! Immortal is thy fame, for it is deeply rooted in human  hearts and human sympathies, and long after thou hast joined the choir  above, may thy melodious strains float down the stream of time to  delight the latest posterity!    Julia sung this sweet air, and several others, with a feeling and pathos  which convinced me she was not the soulless belle I had at first  imagined; indeed, as she sung, every noble and generous emotion beamed  from her lovely face.    No wonder poor Tom was far gone _Ã  la Chatelar_ though things with him  had a somewhat happier termination; as it was, he hung enamoured over  her, delighted evidently with the sensation her singing had produced,  and, âmusic being the food of love,â as we have it on the best  authority, banqueting evidently on this very exciting _pabulum_.    Miss Heartwell having resigned her seat, overwhelmed with praises and  acknowledgments, another young lady was prevailed upon to occupy it.    Several other songs followed, when there was a pause.    The silence was at length broken by the old collector, Mr. Dilkhoob,  marching up to our hostess, and addressing her, arms, a-kimbo, with  well-simulated sternness and severity, in the following manner:â    âMrs. Major Brownstout,â said he, âIâve a very serious cause of  complaint against you, madam, in which your daughters are in some degree  implicated, and in which I will venture to affirm I am joined by all the  rest of the young people in this party.â    A general smile and interchange of looks between those present was the  result of this speech, deemed evidently the precursor of something  merry.    âWell, Mr. Dilkhoob,â responded the old lady, who seemed perfectly to  understand him, âwhat is my transgression?â    âWhy, madam,â said he, âI consider that you have acted in a most  unusual, a most inconsiderate, and a most extraordinary manner, in  inviting so many young folks to your house, myself among the number,  without giving them a dance;â the young men here rubbed their hands;  âbut, madam, as it is never too late to amend our faults, and correct  our backslidings, I propose that we do now have a dance, and that my  friend here, Lieutenant and Adjutant Wigwell, be solicited to send  immediately for a part of his bandittiâI beg pardonâband, I meant, in  order that we may âtrip it as we go, on the light fantastic toeâ this  way,â said he, seizing the hands of the laughing dame, and cutting one  or two most ponderous capers.    âBravo!â was repeated by many voices.    The motion was carried by acclamation, and Lieut. and Adjt. Wigwell  posted off an orderly for some of the musicians.    They soon made their appearance, and a fine swarthy set of fellows they  were, with their chimney-pot caps. There was a little preliminary  clatter in the verandah, and pitching of instruments, when suddenly  clarionet, cymbal, and trombone broke forth in a glorious and  soul-inspiring lilt.    Tables were removed, chairs thrust out, partners engaged, and the  younger portion of Mrs. Brownstoutâs partyâas if suddenly bitten by  tarantulasâwere whirling and bobbing through the mazes of the merry  dance; I footing it away, with Maria for my partner, as well as the best  of them.    A neat supper, with songs, serious and comic, _Ã  la mode Indienne_, and  the collector quite uproarious, terminated one of the pleasantest  evenings I had yet spent in Bengal.    Miss Julia went home in her palkee; Tom and I escorted her to her  bungalow on foot; the former making seven-league strides, in order to  converse a little by the way; I pelting away after him as vigorously as  the man with the steam leg, though not having an equal interest in such  violent locomotion.    The period was now approaching when I was to bid adieu to Barrackpore  for the Upper Provinces, and exchange the life of mingled drill and  gaiety, of which the foregoing little _tableaux_ may serve to give some  idea, for one of constant change from scene to scene, and more in  consonance with a roving disposition.    I was appointed to a regiment at Agra, but about to move to Delhi, the  capital of India, and which is, or was, associated in our minds with  all, or much, that is glorious and striking in Eastern history.    A Captain Belfield, of infantry, from Java, one of the Indian army of  occupation there, going up the country to a staff appointment, kindly  offered to take me under his wing, and afford me the benefit of his  experience.    Though a totally different man in every respect, he was a friend of  Marpeet, who sent me a letter of introduction to him; the conclusion of  it, which I afterwards saw, was rather characteristic of the captain:    âGernon is a real good-hearted lad, but a devil of a griff; so you must  keep a sharp eye upon him as you go up together, that he does not shoot,  drown, or hang you or himself.â    A week before my departure, I got leave to go down to Calcutta, for a  couple of days, for the purpose of hiring a boat to take me up to the  great military station of Cawnpore, from whence I was recommended to  march. I had also a few necessaries to procure, as well as to take leave  of General Capsicum and the widow, of whom I had occasionally accounts  through the roundabout channel of my friend the indigo planter.    Battleton having matters of deep moment to attend to in Calcutta, one of  which I discovered was to order a splendid set of turquoises, bracelets,  brooch, ear rings, all complete, with other _bijouterie_, for the bride  elect (for Mrs. Brownstoutâs hop had fairly brought on the matrimonial  crisis), he offered to accompany me.    One day, after breakfast, consequently, we proceeded to the ghaut, where  we hired a paunchway to take us to the City of Palaces, for the sum of  one rupee; and the tide being in our favour, we struck out into the  noble stream, and were soon on our way to our destination.    The scenery between Calcutta and Barrackpore, a distance of sixteen or  eighteen miles, I thought then, and have always since considered,  extremely rich and picturesque; its characteristics are bold sweeps of  the broad Hooglyâbanks agreeably diversified, with rich foliage of  various forms and tintâclumps of cocoa-nut and bambooâgroves of mango,  tamarind, and plantain. Here a ghaut, with crowds of bathersâthere a  temple, or the white huwailie or kotee house of some European residing  on the banks.    We soon passed the Governor-Generalâs country residence, and the  extensive and beautifully wooded park adjoining, which has a fine effect  from the river; also, riding at anchor among other boats, and at some  little distance from the shore, we had a view of the state pinnace, or  _Soonamooky_, in which that high functionary makes his progresses to the  Upper Provinces. It was an elegant square-rigged vessel, with tapering  masts, painted a light green, if my memory is correct, and profusely,  though tastefully, gilded; hence, in fact, the name.    On we rowed with the rapid tide, and after coursing along two or three  hold sweeps of the river, Calcutta once more broke on my sightâthe  native townâHowrahâthe splendid white buildings of the European  quarterâits forest of shippingâswarming ghautsâmultitudinous boatsâand  all the ant-hill scene of commerce, hustle, and animation, opening upon  us in rapid succession, like the scenes of a diorama.    This approach to the City of Palaces, however, is by no means equal, in  my opinion, to that from the seaward side. Widely different were my  emotions when I next visited this spot.    After many yearsâ residence in the Upper Provinces, amongst rajahs, hill  forts and Hindoo temples, holy shrines and sacred prayagas, groves  resounding with the cry of the peacock, and Mahomedan ruins of departed  grandeur, exploring the haunts of the savage Bheel, and pursuing the  plundering Pindarry through the scenes of his maraudings, familiarized  with scenes, manners, and customs wearing the impress of a hoary  antiquity, and as far removed from the go-ahead things of European  civilization as it is possible to imagine, I once more found myself off  Calcutta.    With my mind thus saturated with new ideasâa sort of âsleepy hollowâ  state having come over me, and the recollections of âfather-landâ fast  escaping from my still fondly tenacious grasp, the first sight of the  tall masts of the shipping, as they burst on my view, on rounding a  point, produced sensations of pleasure as hard to describe, as difficult  to be forgotten; nor were these feelings diminished, when, gliding past  the vessels themselves, I read âLondon,â âLiverpool,â and so forth, on  their sterns, and beheld the rough red-shirted tars, my ruddy stalwart  countrymen, as they gazed at us over the sides, or lounged in groups on  the forecastle, and thought that in very truth but a brief period had  elapsed since those fortunate fellows had been lying in some crowded  bustling port of my own dear native land, with âall her faults,â still  beloved and dear to me.    A visit subsequently to one of them served, by exhibiting once familiar  things, to awaken still more forcibly the recollections of Old England,  and to rekindle that love of country, which, next to that of God and  kindred, is, perhaps, the noblest feeling that can swell the bosom.    I will venture to say there are many of my Anglo-Indian brethren who  have experienced that which I have here feebly attempted to describe.    We landed at Chundpaul ghaut, a spot memorable in my eyes as that of my  disembarkation in Calcutta some two or three months before, and of my  incipient acquaintance with my grandiloquent factotum Chattermohun  Ghose.    From the ghaut we proceeded, in ticca palankeens, to the fort, where  Rattleton and I had been invited to take up our quarters with Lieut.  Rantipole, of the Zubberdust Bullumteers, then on duty there with his  company.    A wonderful place is Fort William, and a hard nut it will be for the  enemies of Old England to crack, if they should ever be induced to  attempt it, whether it be the wily Russian, the gallant Frenchman, or  Brother Jonathan himself.    It is exceedingly wrong to be proudâvery wrong indeedâI know it; but,  nevertheless, I have always carried my chin at an angle of forty-five  degrees with the plane of the horizon, whenever I marched into that  bristling _place dâarmes_. To other pens, less sketchy and discursive  than mine, I must leave its minute description.    Suffice it for my purpose here to observe, that its extent is vast, its  defences admirable, and though making little exterior show, its green  slopes once passed, a battery on the broad grin meets you at every turn,  as much as to say, âA-ha! Iâve caught you, eh!â_on ne peut pas passer  ici_;â in short, its guards, griffs, adjutants, and arsenals, crows,  causeways, cookboys and counterscarps, its mountains of balls and acres  of cannon, are all wonderful and astonishing.                                        CHAPTER XIX.      The day after my arrival at Calcutta I hastened to pay my respects to  the Capsicums. On reaching the portico of the house, I threw myself out  of my palankeen.    âIs the general at home?â    âHe is, _khodabund_,â said the servant, and ascended to announce me.  Upon my entering, and making my bow,    âHa! how are ye, sir; how are ye, sir?â said the old veteran, extending  his hand to me at full length, as he reclined in his easy chair; âglad  to see you again. Well, sir, and how did you lave my son? But Iâve heerd  of all your prosadings.â    Mrs. Capsicum congratulated me on my continued healthy appearance, and  condescended to present me with the âtip of her honourable little  finger.â    I looked around for the dear widow, but she was not there. My pulse sunk  below zero with painful misgivings; ideas of death, matrimony, or some  other misfortune, flashed on my mind: it is the nature of some men  always to fancy things fifty times better or worse than they are, to  which category I belong. I ventured to ask the general after the health  of his daughter, and was greatly relieved by his reply:    âOh, sheâs well, sureâsheâs well; but youâll see her here immediately to  spake for herself.â    Some time before dinner was announced, a carriage drove up to the house;  it contained Mrs. Delaval, who had been absent the whole day in  Calcutta. She soon entered the apartment; it was late in the evening,  the light dim and uncertain, and I seated in a recess near the window.    âWell, Cordalia, my dear, have you seen all your friends and executed  all your commissions?â    Mrs. Delaval kissed her father, and answered in the affirmative, adding,  âthe Coppletons have taken their passage home in the _Derbyshire_; young  Scapegrace, of the civil service, is to be married to Letitia Flirtwell  to-morrow, and Colonel Oddfish sends his _bhote bhote salaam_ to you,  and hopes to see you soon in town.â    After some more gossip of this nature, the general directed the  attention of his charming daughter to me, as âa particular friend of  hers,â and I had the satisfaction of seeing a blush of pleasure and  surprise upon her features at recognizing me.    The reader may readily conceive all that passed immediately after this  and at dinner, and that I had to recount the adventures of the last six  weeks, to fight over again the battle of Junglesoor, and to rekill all  the hogs.    As the night wore away, and long after tea, the old general, who had  been for some time in a ruminating moodâindeed, we had sunk into that  thoughtful state which usually precedes the separation of friendsâlit  his taper, and rising, though with considerable effort, from his easy  chair, beckoned me to follow him.    We entered his dressing room; he desired me to shut the door, and,  sitting down, bade me be seated likewise.    âMy young friend,â said the old man, taking my hand with more feeling  than I had ever yet seen him display, âI wished to say a few words to  you in private before we part, most probably for ever. I loved your  brave uncle, as I have already told you, and I think I should not be  showing a proper respect to his memory, or doing my duty towards his  nephew, did I not offer ye a few words of counsel, the result of long  experience.    âIâm not the hypocrite to preach to you that I have always acted as I  would have you to act; no, âtis not so; Iâd be glad, by Gââ, if it had  been otherwise; but my exparience, like that of most men, has been  dearly bought. You are young, all the world before ye, and about,  probably, to enter on a long and varied career. Life is a game, and a  few false moves at the outset, it may never be in your power fully to  retrave; it therefore behoves you to be cautious, and to weigh well  every step before you take it.    âWhen you join your regiment, beware of your associates, for on the  character of these your future prospects will mainly depend. Be slow in  forming intimacies, but at the same time courteous and kind to all.  Observe, but do not appear to do so, for people do not love to have  spies over them. Take your cheerful glass with your friends, but shun  intemperance, the root of gaming and all evil.    âStrive to live within your manes, and let no man laugh you out of your  resolution to be âjust before you are generous;â for the time will come,  take my word for it, when you will rape the reward of your self-denial.  Make yourself master of your profession, and acquire a taste for rading  and study; if over wild, âtwill beget a new mind in ye, and is the best  manes ye can adopt to save ye from frivolity and dissipation, of which  yeâll find plenty here, by Gââ.    âIndulge moderately in faild sports, for no man in India ever took his  full swing of them that, sooner or later, had not to lament a broken  constitution; the strength of Hercules will not enable Europeans to  brave exposure to an Aistern sun with impunity.    âLay down fixed principles for yourself, and let nothing induce ye to  swerve from them; they are, if I may so say, the helm of our moral  nature; and though the gusts of passion and caprice, or the shoals of  unavoidable difficulties, may sometimes drive us out of our course, if  we have but these we shall regain it; but without them, we become the  sport of every impulse, we drift away to destruction. God knows Iâve  rason to say all this. Acquire courage to say ânoâ when ye feel ye  ought, and thereby shun that rock of over-aisiness on which so many a  youth has made shipwreck of his fortunes.    âAs for religion, I lave ye to judge for yourself; make no joke of any  manâs; whatever has Godâs glory and manâs good as its professed object,  however mistaken, desarves a sort of respect even from an opponent.  Thereâs good enough in most of them, if we would but stick to the  practical part; perhaps, as my old moonshee, Golaum Hyder, used to say,  it may be Godâs pleasure to be approached in more ways than one, so that  we do it with honesty of purpose and in singleness of heart.    âStrive to make friends, but of this rest assured, that no friendship  can be lasting that is not based on respect for some one sterling  quality, at laist, to redaim the many waiknesses which we all, more or  less, inherit; when all looks smiling you may think otherwise, and  overlook this essential, but you will find eventually that in resting on  such summer friends, you lean on a broken reed.    ââTill society finds us other manes of obtaining redress for injuries,  and for stopping the tongues of the brawler, the slanderer, and the  bully, than by the dââd tadious and expinsive process by law  established; which, I suppose, if a man spit in your face, would require  you to prove how much soap it would take to wash it off, and give  damages accordingly: I say, till this is done, fight we must  sometimesâbut avoid quarrels; âtis aisier and more honourable to keep  out of them than to back out of them, and âtis a dreadful thing for a  thrifle (here his voice faltered and he became much agitated) to have  the blood of a comrade on your conscience.    ââTis a hard matter, I know, to put an old head on young shoulders; but  maybe, nevertheless, youâll sometimes think of what Iâve now said to ye.  And now,â he added with a smile, âI believe Iâve finished my sermon, and  have nothing more to add, than may God Almighty bless and prosper ye!â    On saying this, the warm-hearted old Irishman, who was evidently  affected, applied a key with trembling hand to a little escritoire, from  which he took an old-fashioned silver snuff-box. This he rubbed with his  sleeve, looking at it wistfully, and then presented it to me, whilst a  tear trembled in his eyeâthe thoughts of other days rushed upon him.    âThere,â said he; âthat belonged to your poor departed uncle; forty-five  years ago he gave it to me as a mark of his regard; I now here present  it to you as a proof of mine, and in memento of him, the only man on  earth Iâd give it to before I died. I donât recommend you to snuff  yourself generally,â added he, âbut youâll find a pinch in that,â and he  smiled, âthatâll do you good sometimes, if used with discretion and  sparingly, if youâre ever in want of a further supply, let me know; and  now, if ye plase, weâll rejoin the ladies.â    I was deeply touched by the generalâs kindness, and mentally promised  that I would treasure up his counsel, and make it my future guide. I  fear, however, his estimate, touching that extremely difficult operation  of putting an old head on young shoulders, found little in my subsequent  career at all calculated to invalidate its correctness.    Well, I bade a long farewell to the general. Mrs. Capsicum softened as  she bid me adieu, and the charming widow could scarcely conceal her  emotion.    How drearyâhow blank are the first few moments which succeed the parting  with friends! their voices still sounding in your ears, their persons  still vividly before your eyesâsounds and pictures to be impressed on  the sensorium, and carried with you through life, long long, perhaps,  after the originals are departed!âundying echoes! and abiding shadows!    I reached my room at about twelve oâclock, and prepared for rest. My  first act, however, was to take a survey of my uncleâs snuff-box.    It was a singular piece of antiquity, such as might have been handed  round in its time at a meeting of wits at Buttonâs or Willâs, or tapped  by some ruffled exquisite of the glorious reign of Queen Anne. The  well-known arms of my family were engraven on the back, but almost  obliterated by time and use.    Now, thought I, for a peep at the inside, and a pinch of the generalâs  wonderful snuff. I opened the box, but instead of snuff, I found it to  contain, to my great pleasure and astonishment, the following brief, but  highly satisfactory document:â      GENTLEMEN,â      Please to pay to Ens. Gernon, or order, the sum of Rs. 500, on account    of,                                   Gentlemen, your obedient Servant,                                                 DOMINICK CAPSICUM,                                                         _Lieut.-General_.      To Messrs. Princely & Co., _Agents_.    âGenerous old man!â I exclaimed, âsuch snuff as this is indeed useful at  a pinch, though, unlike most snuff, by no means to be sneezed at!â    The next day I devoted to hiring a _bolio_, and some other matters.    A bolio, it may be necessary to inform the reader, is a boat constructed  on a somewhat similar plan to the budgerow, but longer and narrower, and  more confined in its accommodation.    I was to pay Rs. 100, or about Â£10, for a journey of 700 miles. Tom also  ordered his jewellery, visited his agents, and made sundry arrangements  connected with the coming event.    I sought out some of my old ship acquaintances, and having transacted  all necessary business, and ordered my bolio to Barrackpore, Tom and I  returned in a hired gig by land.    We drove through the native town, alive with its heterogeneous  populationâparoquets, fakeers, baboos, palkees, &c., and through almost  an unbroken avenue of trees, to Barrackpore, sixteen miles distant.    The next day I called on Capt. Belfield, with whom I arranged to depart  in two or three days. He proposed that I should take my meals with them  on my way up as far as Dinapore, to which I consented; this, besides  promising to be agreeable in other respects, saved me the expense of a  cook-boat.    The captain introduced me to his sister, who had resided with him for  some time in Java.    Miss Belfield was âa lady of a certain age,â once more briefly expressed  by the term âold maid;â but she was neither an envious old maid, nor a  spiteful old maid, nor an intensely blue old maid, nor a canting old  maid; but she was a cheerful, bland, and intellectual woman of  thirty-five, with a mind deeply imbued with religious feeling, and not  without a dash of sentiment.    Celibacy, which so often in women turns the milk of human kindness to  gall, seemed in her, as sometimes happens, to have had the opposite  effect, and to have given it additional sweetness; in fact, all the  world was her lover, and she had never given her heart to one, from a  feeling, perhaps, that ââtwas meant for mankind.â    Having lost her last surviving parent, a clergyman, whose income, though  large, arose almost solely from his preferment, she had been obliged to  change the home of her infancy for a state of galling half-dependence on  distant relatives, who made her _feel_ their kindness in the least  pleasing manner. From this state she was relieved by an invitation from  her only and bachelor brother, Capt. Belfield, to come out and  superintend his establishment in India; and, certainly, a happier or  more amiable pair were never seen together.    Capt. Belfield told me at what ghaut his budgerow, horse, and cook-boat  were lying, and recommended me to send my bolio to the same place, as it  was his intention to quit Barrackpore in a couple of days.    The next two days were busily occupied in paying farewell visits,  packing up my valuables, as also in hiring one or two additional  servants, which swelled my establishment to six.    I here recount the names, occupations, and salaries of the individuals.    First in the list was Ramdial, sirdar-bearer, my _valet de chambre_, an  old Hindoo, with wondrous frail supporters and a grizzled moustache; he  served me for Rs. 6 per mensem; was a truly honest native, and would  never allow anybody to cheat me,âbut himself.    Next came Rumjan Khan, khitmutgar, or footman; salary, Rs. 7 per mensem.  Rumjan served me with fidelity till we got about fifty miles above  Calcutta, when, not finding the air of the river to agree with him, he  left me rather suddenly, with the contents of my plate-chest,âto wit,  six silver spoons and a brace of muffineers.    The third in point of rank in my establishment was Nannoo, dhobee, or  washerman; salary, Rs. 6: a hardworking, harmless creature, who pegged  away at his wash-board daily. A pretty wife, a large brazen iron (the  Hibernianism is unavoidable), and three fat naked piccaninies, always on  the crawl at the top of my bolio, seemed to constitute the amount of his  earthly treasures.    Fourthly came Bahadoor Khan, mussalchee, or link-boy; the province of  this servant is to carry the torch, or lantern, and to scour out the  saucepans and tea-kettle, clean knives, fetch milk, &c.; but as I had  not much for him to do in that way, I made him my head chasseur; salary,  Rs. 4 per mensem, or eight shillings, not too much, one would suppose,  for the decent clothing and maintenance of a man and his family.    Next (hired for his special utility on a river journey) came Hyder Bux,  bhistie, or water-carrier, a terrible thick-set fellow; a devout  Mahomedan, with a beard so bushy and luxuriant, that, with his hooked  nose and large eyes, he always reminded me of an owl looking out of an  ivy-bush.    Last on the list, but not least in importance, at least to me, was  Nuncoo, matar, my master of the buckhounds.    I shall draw a veil over some of the peculiar duties of Nuncoo, but  others I shall particularize; they were, the care of Hector the  bull-dog, and Teazer theâI was going to say _soi-disant_âterrier, in  preparing daily for them a very large mess of rice and turmeric, with a  few small bits of meat interspersed.    Poor Bull, this Gentoo fare, I suspect, but ill agreed with your  Whitechapel constitution, and seemed to hasten your end.    The prospect of a change was highly agreeable to me, though mingled with  a regret at the necessity it involved of a separation from my friend  Tom, for whom I had a very warm affection.    Rattleton was equally sorry to part with me, particularly as he wished  me to be present at his marriage, in the capacity of bridegroomâs man,  and which event was to take place in ten days.    âFrank, we must pass the last evening cosily together,â said he; âI must  be with Julia till half-past seven, but for the remainder of the evening  I am yours.â    It is needless to trouble the reader with any account of what passed  between Tom and me, in this the last evening of our sojourn together;  past hours were revived and future pleasures anticipated. Tom spoke in  rapture of his approaching happiness, and of the liberality of the young  ladyâs uncle, who had already presented them with a new bungalow.    âSheâs an angel, Frank,â said he, âif ever there was one on earth; may  you find just such another! and if you do, and can, by exchange or  otherwise, find your way back to the Zubberdust Bullumteers, we shall  make the happiest quartet in the country. âTwill be so pleasant to pass  our evenings together, wonât it? a little music, and chess, and so  forth.â    Battleton accompanied me to Captain Belfieldâs budgerow, where we took  an affectionate farewell of each other, he promising to write to me a  full, true, and particular account of the wedding.    Poor Tom! the next time we met was some years after; he ascending the  Ganges, I going down. It was by mere accident we discovered each other,  not having for some time communicated, and cordial was our greeting.  There was still a dash of sadness in it, like a gleam of wintry  sunlight. The joyous anticipations of the lover had long since subsided  into the cares, the anxieties, and the troubles of the husband and  father.    The predictions of the caustic captain had been in some sort realized.  The quarter-mastership had, it is true, in due time, become vacant; but,  in the interim, âanother king had arisen, who knew not Joseph,â and Tom  had in consequence failed to obtain it.    Thought and moody care sat on the brow of the once joyous Rattleton, for  debts were accumulating, children coming fast, and the fair Juliaâs  health was beginning to fail: to send her âhome,â at the expense of some  thousand rupees, or see her die before his eyes, were the painful  alternatives between which he would shortly have to choose.    Even Tom himself complained of hepatic derangementâ_vulyÃ²_, the  liverâand could not take his quantum of beer-shrob as of yore; a  springtide of crosses and difficulties, in fact, had set in upon him.    Just before we met, he had sustained a not uncommon river disaster; his  horse-boat had been upset by a whirlwind, by which he had lost his  buggy, two horses, and other property, to the value of Rs. 1,500, for  which he could claim no compensation. Three of his servants went down  with the boat, as if to verify the old adage.    He had barely recovered from the shock occasioned by this misfortune,  when he had to sustain another, though of a different kind. He had  discovered that his childâs _dhye_, or native nurse, was in the habit of  dosing his infant with opium, that it might not disturb her slumbers.  Tom threatened; madam took huff, and marched off; the delicate Julia was  in despair. The only succedaneum that might have been rendered  available, a goat, had accompanied the horses to the shades below.    Ye who send sons and daughters to India, imagine not that they are  always reposing on beds of roses.    Alas! poor Tom, thou hadst a gallant spirit, but heavy was the sigh  which ever and anon escaped thee, as thou didst detail thy difficulties  to me during the brief hour we then spent together!    Much hadst thou to tell of the trials of a married sub, on small means,  and kept much on the move; but I must reserve it for some other  occasion, âwith the rest of Tomâs story,â as Corporal Trim would say,  âfor it forms a part of it.â    In Juliaâthe shawled, be-capped, and languid invalidâI could scarcely  think that I was indeed looking on the belle of Barrackpore, truly the  âlight of the ball-room.â    I had nearly omitted to mention a circumstance which occurred on the  previous day, with which it is of importance that the reader should be  made acquaintedâto wit, an unexpected visit I had from my friend  Chattermohun Ghose.    On going into Tomâs verandah, to order the despatch of some chattels to  my bolio, I observed a Bengalee at one extremity of it, his head going  like that of a Chinese mandarin.    I discovered that these profound salaams were intended for me. I  advanced towards the automaton, and immediately recognized the  patriarchal proprietor of âfive effective children of various  denominations,â Chattermohun Ghose.    âHah! Chattermohun, my fine fellow, is that you?â said I. âWhat brought  you to Barrackpore?â    âI came, sair, for argent private affair; two, three gentilman owe me  little bill here, and accidentally I have learn by chance that master  was ishtaying here; therefore I think my duty to pay respect; master  make me great obligation; master is my father, to whom my everlasting  gratitude will be due.â    âAs for being your father, Chattermohun,â said I, laughing, âno one  would suspect that, for if I am not mistaken, you are old enough to be  mine; and why you should be so grateful towards me, I cannot imagine.â    Some writer has well observed, that âgratitude is too often but a lively  sense of favours to come;â to Asiatics, or natives of India, at all  events, this remark applies with more force than to Europeans in  general. That my friend Chattermohunâs gratitude partook largely of this  prospective character, soon became abundantly apparent.    âMaster I understand will shortly go ope contree?â    âYes, Chattermohun, Iâm off to-morrowâplease the pigs; have you any  commands?â    âNo, sair, command not got; butâââ    Here was a pause; after which, Chattermohun resumed his plan of  operations in the usual wily style of the Bengalee; any one of whom Iâll  pit against any Jew in the Minories.    âDoes master know,â said he, with an air of perfect unpremeditation,  âone gintleman name Captain Belfil, who was shortly go Danapore?â    âOh, yes,â said I, falling into the trap; âto be sure I do; weâre going  up together.â    âMaster go up contree with Captain Belfil? I not know thatâ (the  vagabond had come up on purpose to make his approaches through me);  âthen that will be good bisâness for master; master very clever  gintleman, but little too much young to go up river by ownself. I think  Master Belfil will be in paymaster bisânessâgot good âpointment up  contree?â    âYes,â I replied, âI believe he hasâpaymaster of invalids, somewhere or  other. But now, Chattermohun, my good fellow, make yourself scarce, if  you please, for Iâve a plaguy deal to attend to, and must be very busy.â    Chattermohun raised his hand, enveloped in its snowy, muslin drapery,  slowly to his forehead, and made me a profound salaam, but stirred  notâthere was evidently something in the background. At last, out it  plumped.    âWill master please to _ishpik_ in my favour?â    âTo whom? for what? what the dââl do I know of you, Chattermohun?â    âCaptain Belfil, I learn by proper intelligence, have need of âspectable  writer. I wonât go back old army bisâness, Calcuttaâbisâness not make  too much pecuniary profitâtherefore, master please to give me  recommendation, I shall, _plis_ God, get that place.â    âOh, oh!â said I, âMr. Chattermohun; and this is the object of your  visit to me, eh!âof your everlasting gratitude, and my newly-dubbed  paternity?â    âNo, sair, âpon my honour, not for that only, but master I think have  great benevolence to do me favour.â    I liked Chattermohun; those who cannot carry it by storm, must try it by  sap; so I promised to certify on paper all that I knew in his favour,  and a little more.    To my surprise, it produced the desired effect. Chattermohun got the  _writership_, joined the fleet, and became our _comapagnon de voyage_.    They say there is no word for _gratitude_ in the native language, and  consequently that the quality is unknown; certainly, Chattermohun was  grateful to me, poor fellow, for the service rendered him, as far as was  in his power to be so. Gratitude is certainly more easily professed than  felt amongst black and white; but to deny that it can exist, is to libel  human nature.    Capt. Belfield and his sister gave me a most kind and friendly  reception; as an agreeable earnest of the pleasure of the voyage,  breakfast was on the table when I entered the budgerow, Miss Belfield  presiding over its arrangements with English neatness and propriety,  just as she had been accustomed to do, no doubt, for many a happy year,  at Long Somerton.    The windows or venetians were up on both sides, affording an agreeable  view of the river and its banks; under one, there was a grand scene of  bathing, praying, and filling of water-pots. Many a dark eye of a Hindoo  girl stole furtive glances at the strange meal and paraphernalia of the  terrific European, while the sharp aspirations from the lungs of  numerous _dhobees_, or washermen, banging their clothes, sounded along  the shore.    The _dandies_, or boatmen, now drew on board the _seree_, or plank  connecting us with the shore, threw water over the figure-head, touched  their foreheads, shouted â_Gunga gee ke jy!_âââSuccess, or victory to  the holy Gangesââleaped on board, and our whole fleet was soon under  weigh: beginning act the third of my griffinage.    This mode of travelling in India though extremely tedious or perhaps  rather, I should say, occupying a vast deal of time, and, when the river  is swollen by the periodical rains and the melting of the snow, attended  with considerable danger, is, nevertheless, in some respects,  exceedingly pleasant and convenient.    The sitting-room in a good-sized budgerow is as large as a small  parlour, seven or eight feet in height, and, when fitted up with table,  chairs, couch, book-shelves, &c., is as comfortable as an apartment on  shore. The venetians open inwards, and may be raised and hooked to the  ceiling along both sides of the rooms or cabins, of which there are  usually two, one a dormitory, affording, as you glide along, a pleasant  view of bathers, boats, temples, ghauts, and the other various  picturesque objects which generally adorn the banks of Indian rivers.    The _dandies_, or boatmen (not quite such dressy fellows as their  namesakes at home, a rag or waistcloth constituting their working suit),  tow the boats at the rate of fourteen or sixteen miles a day; each man  has a stout piece of bamboo, with a string attached; the latter he  attaches to the towing line, placing the former over his shoulder.    In ascending, the oars are seldom made use of, excepting in crossing the  river, or in passing long lines of moored boats, when they are sometimes  deemed preferable to passing the towing line over each separate  masthead, which is a troublesome operation, and productive of infinite  squabbling and abuse between the crews.    The term _budgerow_ is a corruption of the word _barge_, and the idea of  those in common use in India has evidently been taken from the state  barges, once more used by colonial governors than at present, as a state  appendage, and which once also in London, in the olden time, served the  purposes of transit amongst the great which coaches do at present.  Specimens of them still survive in the Lord Mayorâs barge and those of  public companies.    We soon left Barrackpore behind us, and the pretty Danish settlement of  Serampore oppositeâthe Bengal city of refuge for the fugitives of John  Doe and Richard Roeâand in a little time passed the French possession of  Chandernagore, and the Dutch factory of Chinsurah.    In the evening we reached Bandel, an ancient Portuguese settlement,  celebrated for its cream cheeses, which are rather so-so, and a pretty  Roman Catholic chapel and convent, coeval, I imagine, with the earliest  settlement of the Portuguese in Bengal.    The shades of evening were gathering around as we slowly brought to and  moored our boats for the night. Lights from many a nook and ghaut on the  river began to shed their trembling rays across its surface. The  crescent moon, in silver sheen, like a fairy of light, was just rising  above the tops of the cocoa-nut trees; and the clash of gongs and  cymbals resounded from the neighbouring bazaars, telling it was the hour  of joy and relaxation.    Captain Belfield proposed a saunter before tea, to which his sister and  myself gladly assented; and it was agreed that we should explore the  little paraclete before us, which, in its pure and modest whiteness,  seemed, as it were, tranquilly reposing in the mingled moon and  twilight.    The captain took his stick, a stout shillelagh of some Javanese wood, on  the merits of which he afterwards often expatiated; Miss Belfield,  bonneted and scarfed; I tendered my arm, like an attentive young man,  and followed by a chaprassee and the captainâs black terrier, _Thug_, we  commenced our first eveningâs ramble.    âHow delightfully tranquil is your evening hour in India!â said Miss  Belfield. âAs far as my experience goes, I should almost say it  compensates for the fiery sun of the day.â    âIt is a relief, certainly,â said the captain. âOld PhÅbusâ  disappearance below the horizon in this country, and the effect produced  by it on man and beast, remind me of that which usually followed the  exit of my old preceptor from the school-roomâa general uproar and  rejoicing.â                                        CHAPTER XX.      The little church of Bandel is a pleasing, modest structureâits white  tower, cross, cloisters, and adjoining priestâs house and garden,  creating a pleasing illusion; transporting the spectator in imagination  (forgetting he is in India) to the orange groves of Portugal or Madeira.    The vesper bell had ceased to sound as we slowly entered the building.  The interior was invested with a deepening gloom, but partially broken  by the waning light of evening, which, streaming in at the windows,  chequered the worn pavement, pencilling, as it were, with its sad and  sober ray, the touching but evanescent record of another departing day.    Within, all was silence and repose, save when slightly broken by the  closing of a door, or the echo of a distant footfall.    The altars, with their splendid adornments of the Romish ritual, tapers,  crucifixes, &c., sparkled through the âdim, religious lightâ of the  place, whilst here and there a few solitary native Portuguese women, on  their knees, met our eyes, absorbed in silent prayer.    The scene was solemn and impressive; my light thoughts fled, and a deep  sense of the holiness and loveliness of devotion fell upon me. We moved  through the body of the church and the adjoining courts and cloisters,  pleased with the tranquillity of the spot, before we bent our steps  towards the budgerow, whose whereabouts was now plainly indicated by the  numerous fires of our servants and boatmen, cooking their evening meal  on the banks.    âWell, Ann!â said the captain to his sister, as we sauntered along,  âwhat do you think of the old chapel of Bandel?â    âI have been greatly pleased with it,â answered Miss Belfield; âwith me,  you know,                   âEven the faintest relics of a shrine                 Of any worship wake some thought divine.â    But truly there is something _par excellence_ in these old Catholic  ecclesiastical buildings, which always, good Protestant as I am, takes a  powerful hold on my feelings and imagination; hallowed by their  association with the events of the misty past, they awaken the most  solemn reflections. To have trodden, too, as we have just done, those  very aisles where the adventurous Portuguese of the olden time of India  (now some centuries past) have put up their orisons, is well worth our  evenings ramble. Yes,â she added, with some enthusiasm, âwhatever be the  defects of its tenets and doctrines, Romanism unquestionably contains  the very poetry of religion.â    âAnn! my dear Ann!â exclaimed the captain, âwhat would your old friend  Parson Martext, of Long Somerton, say, were he to hear you talking thus?  Fie! fie! The âmisty past,â as you poetically term it,â continued  Captain Belfield (who, I began to discover, was a matter-of-fact-man,  who had curbed and double-bitted his fancy, and was not perhaps quite so  orthodox as he should have been), âis too often a region of delusion, in  which flying the dull realities of the present, the feelings and  imagination love to revelâa sort of moral _mirage_ rests upon it. With  too many, as they approach it, judgment abandons the reins of the  understanding, whilst enthusiasm seizes them, and drives away Heaven  knows whither. In the distant mountain fadingâin aerial tints of gold  and purple, infancy paints a heaven, whilst experience tells of rocks  and caverns, cataracts and precipices. I am myself, I confess, disposed  to entertain many of your feelings in such situations, but reading and  reflection have taught me to moderate themâto distinguish, I hope,  between feelings and rational convictionsâromance and realityâin more  senses than one; be assured the âheart of man is deceitful above all  things.â But, my dear Ann,â he added, âwe are becoming a vast deal too  solemn and didactic. Iâm sure our young friend here will think so. These  subjects are caviare to those just entering on the spring of life, to  which we, you know, are beginning to turn our backs. Here we are at the  budgerow, love! Tea, too, on table! Now, then, take care how you walk  over the plank; a dip in the Hoogly would be a chilling _finale_ to your  eveningâs ramble. Mr. Gernon, give my sister your hand, if you please.  Here we are, once more, on board our first-rate.â    I was not long in discerning that Captain Belfield was a learned  Thebanâa great Oriental scholar; a prodigious number of books he had,  too, lying about the cabin, in worm-eaten Indian covers, and in all  sorts of crambo charactersâPersian, Nagree, Pali, and I know not what  besides; with dictionaries, many of formidable bulk.    He maintainedâfor Captain Belfield, like most men, had his hobby, and  was, moreover, at that time writing a book to prove itâthat we have  received almost all our _raw_ notions of things in general from the  East, to which we are, in fact, more indebted than it suits the policy  of the world to acknowledge; and that now, after a score or two of  centuries, we are merely rendering them back their own in a  _manufactured_ or modified form.    Our feudal system, our juries, our best jokes, our cleverest tales, our  wisest aphorisms, and much more besides, were, according to him, all  filched from the Hindoos. The captain was not a man to be led away by  strained analogies and forced etymologies; so I put great faith in his  _dicta_âa faith which has not been shaken by my post-griffinish  researches.    He had better grounds to go upon than the old Irish colonel, who took up  the converse of the proposition, and proved, or endeavoured to prove,  that the Hindoos sprung from the Irish, that Sanscrit was a corruption  of their vernacular, their veneration for the cow nothing more than a  natural transition from their well-known partiality for _bulls_; and  that the mildness, temperance, and placability of the race all smacked  strongly of Tipperary.    On the evening to which I am referring, Captain Belfield soon became  absorbed in his books, whilst Miss Belfield and I sat down to chess. We  had two well-contested games; I won them both, and though I bore my  victory meekly enough, I perceived, or thought I perceived, that it  would not do to repeat my triumphs too often.    Chess is a fine, intellectual game, no doubt, but, somehow or other, a  sad tryer of the temper; and, whether beaten or victorious, unless  possessed of more than ordinary tact and self-command, you may chance to  quarrel with, and possibly alienate, your friend.    Thus, then, with some little variety, reading, or conversation, passed  we the evenings of our sojourn togetherâthe pleasantest by far of my  griffinage.    The voyage to Burhampore, the first large military station on the river,  occupied ten or twelve days. I shall briefly touch on a few more of its  incidents.    In spite of General Capsicumâs friendly advice to indulge moderately in  field sports, like ninety nine out of every hundred griffins, I  commenced my popping operations almost from the day of starting, keeping  up a sort of running fire, with little intermission, till I reached my  destination.    My knowledge of Indian ornithology being extremely limited, I  declared war against all of the feathered race that presented  themselvesâparticularly the paddy-birds and snippets. The first, a  sort of small crane, abounding in the rice-fields, and which it is  considered by sportsmen the _acmÃ©_ of Johnny-rawism to shoot, under  the impression that they are game; the second, a sort of sand-lark,  which runs ducking along the banks of the river, and are so tame,  being accustomed to boats, that it is difficult to make them take  wing. These, in my simplicity, I took for Bengal snipes, and  sometimes, poor little devils, opened a point-blank battery on them  from my bolio window, knocking them, of course, to âimmortal smash.â    I had, it is true, gained an inkling from Tom and Marpeet touching the  nature of such proceedings, with some warnings to avoid them, though it  was reserved for Captain Belfield, a few days after we left Hoogly, to  renew the admonition, with better effect. This arose out of the  following occurrence.    I returned one evening to his budgerow, ladenâ_i.e._, Ramdial, bearer,  and Nuncoo, matar, were charged with the porterage of the following  miscellaneous bag of game, to wit: a cock-vulture, with fine red wattles  (which I shot, thinking he was a wild turkey), four snippets, five  paddy-birds, three doves, a gillarie, or striped squirrel, a braminy  kite, and a jackal.    The boats were just coming to, the poor dandies, after a hard dayâs  pull, winding up their tow-lines, and old PhÅbus himself just sinking to  rest, spreading his glorious hues over the broad bosom of the Bagheriti,  as,                               Spent with extreme toil,                       Weary and faint,    I made my appearance, after a long exploration among mango groves, paddy  fields, and sugar-cane kates,[33] in search of game.    The captain was seated on the roof of the budgerow as I hove in sight;  his amiable sister, parasol in hand, beside him, talking of Long  Somerton, in all probability, and enjoying the beauties of the scene and  the coolness and tranquillity of the hour.    âWell, Gernon,â said the former, who had now dropped the âMr.â in  addressing me, âwhat sport? what have you killed?âtoo well employed to  think of dinner, of course!â    âOh! capital, sir,â said I; âall in that bag, and more besides.â    âQuantity, certainly; but what are they?â added he, âfor that, after  all, is the main point.â    âPray bring them on board,â said Miss Belfield; âI am curious to see  some of the Indian game, to ascertain in what respect they differ from  ours at home.â    âWith the greatest pleasure,â returned I, glad of an opportunity to  exhibit the contents of my bag; âyou shall see them immediately.â    So saying, I went on board, and joined my friends on the roof, Ramdial  following with the bag, and Nuncoo dragging up the jackal by the tail.  Ye Gods! how the captain, albeit a grave man on ordinary occasions, did  laugh, as Ramdial tumbled out the contents of my cornucopia!    âHa! ha! ha! why, you have made a dayâs sport of it, indeed,â he  exclaimed; âbut you donât intend, I hope, that we should eat them all?â    âThe snipes and the doves,â said I, modestly, âand those things,  something like woodcocks, might not, I thought, be bad eating.â    âSnipes!â echoed the captain, âI see no snipes.â    âNo, sir! why, what are these?â I asked, holding up one of my snippets  by the bill; âarenât these Bengal snipes?â    âBengal snipes! no! nor snipes at all; miserable snippets; but with you,  I presume, all long bills are snipes?â    âNo, not exactly,â said I; âbut allowing for difference of latitude and  longitude, I thought these might very well be snipes.â    âAh! I see,â said the captain, âI must put you in the way of managing  matters. I have long relinquished the gun, for I found I was getting too  fond of it, and, after a few years, the sun tells; but I must resume it  for a day or two, in order to initiate you a little into the proper  nature of Indian sporting, and to show you where real snipes and game  are to be found. All this is mere waste of powder and shot (which you  will find a very expensive article, by the way, in India), and will get  you, if you continue it, dubbed an egregious griffin or greenhorn. A  jackal, too! what made you shoot him?â    âHe bolted from a bush, and I thought he was a wolf and floored him  beautifully; as I rolled him over âtwas fine fun to see the courage with  which Teazer and the bull attacked him when in his last agonies.  However, I should not have spared him, had I at first been aware of what  he was, for I owe the whole race a grudge for their infernal yellings. I  was kept awake for some hours last night by a troop of the fiends close  under my bolio window.â    âAh!â said Belfield, âyou have destroyed a useful scavenger; never kill  without an adequate purpose; if we have a right to slay, it is not in  mere wantonness; âshoot only what you can eatâ is a good maxim.â    âMr. Gernon,â said Miss Belfield, âthough my brother undervalues your  sport, it may be some consolation to you to know that I do not; I want  to sketch all the curious birds and animals I see, for a very dear  friend of mine at Long Somerton, who exacted a promise from me, at  parting, that I would do so. Will you, therefore, bring them all on  board to-morrow, the poor jackal included, and you shall group whilst I  sketch them?â    âCapital!â said I; âwith the greatest pleasure; and weâll have Nuncoo as  the Indian huntsman in the foreground: we shall,â I added rather  wickedly, âin this little dedication to the fine arts, be working out  the captainâs utilitarian principle, as applied to sporting.â    Captain Belfield was as good as his word; he put his double-barrelled  Manton together, after a long repose apparently, in its case, where, in  dust certainly, if not in _ashes_, it had mourned its state of inaction,  mustered several of his servants, and out we sallied in the afternoon of  the following day.    Captain Belfield, from his perfect knowledge of the language and the  peopleâwhom, I observed, he always treated with great kindnessâwas soon  able to ascertain the spot in the neighbourhood of the river where the  game was to be found (there is but little, comparatively, in this part  of Bengal), and which I should probably have been long in discovering;  to them we accordingly went, and found hares, black partridges, and  abundance of real snipes, which I perceived did not differ in the  smallest degree from English ones; and I had the supreme felicity of  bagging something more respectable than paddy-birds and snippets, which  I afterwards treated with proper contempt.    The captain, although he had been so long on the retired list as a  sportsman, fired a capital good stick nevertheless, and knocked the  black partridges about, right and left, in great style; indeed, he once  or twice, to borrow a not very delicate sporting phrase, âwiped my noseâ  in a very off-hand manner, proofs of his powers as a marksman with which  I could have readily dispensed; as next probably, to a smack in the  face, there are few things more disagreeable than having your ânose  wiped.â    The black partridge of India, I must inform the reader, is a beautiful  bird; its breast (_i.e._, the maleâs), glossy shining black, spangled  with round and clearly defined white spots; its haunts are the long  grass on the borders of jheels and marshes, from whence it creeps, in  the mornings and evenings, into the neighbouring cultivation.    When flushed, up he goes, as straight as a line, to a certain elevation,  and then off with him, at a right angle, like a dart. He is by no means  an easy shot, though, from his mode of rising, it would appear  otherwise.    It will be long ere I forget the thrill of pleasure I experienced when I  dropped my first black partridge on this occasion, and how pompously,  after ascertaining his specific gravity, I consigned him to my bag,  taking him out about every five minutes, to indulge in another  examination. It is difficult to express the contempt with which I then  viewed my quondam friends, the snippets and paddy-birds.    The prodigious quantity of water-fowl to be seen on some of the shallow  lakes or jheels of India, is well calculated to astonish the European  beholder. I have seen clouds of them rise from such sheets of water,  particularly in the upper part of the Dooab, with a sound sometimes not  unlike the roar of a distant park of artillery; geese of two or three  sorts; ducks, teal, coots, saruses, and flamingoes; the latter, however,  should perhaps be excepted from the concluding part of the remark, for a  string of these beautiful scarlet and flame-coloured creatures, floating  silently in the air, or skimming, on lazy pinions, over an expanse of  water, seem like a chain of fairies, or bright spirits of some Eastern  tale, descending gently to earth; nor do I think this is an exaggerated  description, as all will allow who have seen the flame-coloured cordon  on the wing.    Having now been put in the way of doing things according to rule, I no  longer, as I have before hinted, molested such ignoble birds and beasts  as, in my state of innocence, I was wont to destroy. No more did I nail  the unhappy snippets to the bank from my bolio window nor disturb the  âlorn cooings of the turtle-dove in her bower of mango shade, by a  rattling irruption of No. 6; but in a steady, sportsmanlike form,  accompanied by Ramdial (who, by the way, had no sinecure of it), laden  with _chattah_ (umbrella), game-bag, and brandy-pawney bottle in  leathern case, and Nuncoo, the dog-keeper, with Teazer and the bull-dog,  I was almost daily in the jheels and swamps, mud-larking after the ducks  and snipes.    The reader will think, probably, and I am not disposed to question the  correctness of his opinion, that bull-dogs are not the best of the  species that can be selected for snipe-shooting.    Granted, I say again; but he will be pleased to remember that there are  such disagreeable things as tigers and wild boars (and great _bores_  they are too) to be met with in India. It therefore struck me that, in  case of an unexpected rencontre with one or other of these creatures,  the bull-dog might do good service, by making a diversion in my favour,  and in concert with Teazer, attacking the enemy in flank and rear,  keeping him in check, whilst I fell back on the fleet, as many a valiant  and experienced general had done before me.    Hector, however, though reserved for such important purposes, took no  pleasure in the sport; his heart was with the flesh pots of Whitechapel,  and Nuncoo had sometimes hard work to get him through the swamps; Teazer  behaved better, and, indeed, for a dog of such very low extraction,  displayed a better nose than I expected.    [Illustration: Griffin Mudlarking in the Jheels.]    Happy! happy days of my griffinage! first full swing of the gun! none  before or since have been like unto ye! Had I then set up for a second  Mahomed, and described a paradise, snipe-shooting in a jheel would have  infallibly been included amongst its most prominent enjoyments!    The country in this part of Bengal is a dead flat, composed of a rich  alluvial soil, in a high state of cultivation. Rice, sugar-cane, Palma  Christi, and fifty other tropical productions, flourish luxuriantly, and  charm the sight by their novelty.    The face of the country is covered with groves of mango, tamarind, and  plantain trees, &c.; and numerous towns and villages are scattered here  and there, but which, however, have little that is striking or  interesting in their appearance, mud or matting being the predominant  materials with which they are constructed.    Still the vastness of the population, the number and variety of the  boats on the river, transporting up and down the rich and varied produce  of India, and the diversity of the objects to be seen on the banks as  you slowly glide along, are extremely pleasing. Miss Belfield, being a  finished sketcher, was daily in raptures with all she saw. Full often  would she summon me to the budgerow window, to look at something  exceedingly picturesqueâsome glimpse, effect, or âpretty bit,â as she  was wont to term it, and which had awakened all her admiration.    Some old and magnificent banyan-tree, exhibiting a forest of shade, and  whose tortuous roots, like sprawling boa-constrictors, overhung the  stream; village maidens filling their water-pots beneath it, or fading  like phantasmagoric figures in the deepening gloom of the receding  woodland-path; or some Brahmin standing mid-leg in the water, with eye  abased, and holding his sacred thread; cattle sipping, or the huge  elephant, like a mountain of Indian-rubber, half-immersed, and patiently  undergoing his diurnal scrubbing and ablution.    I caught all her enthusiasm, and great was the sketching and dabbling in  water-colours which followed thereon.    Captain Belfield possessed a far more extensive library than my friend  Tom Rattleton, comprising many standard works on Indian history,  geography, antiquities, &c.; to these, for he was no monopolist in any  shape, he kindly gave me free access, and when not occupied by blazing  at the snipes, or in aiding Miss Belfield in her graphic operations, I  found in his library stores an ample fund of amusement.    I pored over the _seer ul Mutakhereen_, and formed an extensive  acquaintance amongst the twelve million gods of the Hindoo Pantheon.    How genuine, how refreshing, by the way, is the _bonhomie_ of the  Mahomedan author of the _seer ul Mutakhereen!_ with what grave  simplicity and _naÃ¯vetÃ©_ does he relate the sayings and doings of our  valiant countrymen in the early times of Anglo-Indian history!    His comparison of the red Feringhie[34] soldiers, firing in battle, to a  long brick wall, belching forth fire and smoke, is admirable. And how  excellent the story of Beebee Law, and the stem reproof administered to  the fawning Asiatic parasite, the young noble at Patna, by the sturdy  English commander, when the former tried to ingratiate himself by  insulting his fallen enemy, the gallant Frenchman!    How striking, too, when recording these acts, the energy and  astonishment with which, as if irresistibly impelled thereto, he  apostrophizes the virtues of the Englishâtheir high-souled contempt of  deathâtheir fortitude under reverses, and moderation in successâlikening  them to the Rustums and Noushervans of old, Asiatic types of valour and  justice; showing that there is a moral sense, an eternal standard of  nobleness, which no adverse circumstances of habit, climate, and  education can wholly obliterate or destroyâthat virtue is not wholly  conventional!    And oh! admirable Orme! thou minute chronicler of still minuter events,  ungrateful, indeed, should I deem myself, did I not here acknowledge my  obligations to thee; did I not record the many pleasant hours I have  spent in poring over thy pages, whilst tracing the career of thy now  antiquated worthies, from Clive to Catabominaigue!    As we approached the classic ground of Plassey, both poetry and  patriotism began to stir within me. I studied Ormeâs account of the  battle attentively, and determined, as doubtless many had done before  me, to attempt to identify the existing local features with those  incidentally mentioned in the narrative of that important event, the  first act of the greatest work of modern days,âthe conquest, government,  and civilization, by a handful of remote islanders, of one hundred  millions of men; a work, be it observed, though still progressing, which  if left to liberal and practical minds, can hardly fail to be effected  (though yearly increasing in difficulty), if fanaticism on the one hand,  and ultra liberalism on the other, be not allowed prematurely to mar it.    Miss Belfield expressed great veneration for the memory of the Indian  hero, and begged to be allowed to accompany us to the scene of his  crowning exploit.    âThe more the merrier, my dear,â said her brother, and out we all  sallied to visitâthrilling nameââThe field of Plassey.â    A very pleasant stroll we had, too; but all our endeavours to harmonize  the then aspect of the country (and doubtless it is much the same now)  with Ormeâs description of it were utterly nugatory; hunting lodge,  mango tope, and every other memorial and mark of the fight mentioned by  that accurate historian, having been swept away by the river, which,  since 1757, has entirely changed its course.    If any future Clive should fight a battle in Bengal, decisive of the  fate of India, and feel at all desirous that the field of his fame  should remain intact, I would respectfully advise him not to come to  blows within twenty good miles of the Ganges, if he can possibly avoid  it, for that headlong flood, in the course of its erratic movements,  will sooner or later be sure to sweep it away.    An example of the tortuosity of the course of the Bagheriti, and of the  way in which both it and the great Ganges abandon their beds and form  new ones, leaving miles of their former channels unoccupied, or formed  into stagnant lakes, was afforded at Augurdeep, a few miles from  Plassey.    After a long dayâs journey (some fifteen or sixteen miles), we observed,  to our great surprise, that we had halted within a few hundred yards of  the spot from whence we had set out in the morning, the masts of boats  moored there being visible across a narrow neck of land, or isthmus,  connecting with the main land the peninsula we had been all day  circumnavigating.    This isthmus, in after years, was cut through, the river beating in full  force against it, leaving, of course, a great extent of channel dry. If  Cliveâs victory, therefore, had left no more lasting memorial than the  field on which it was gained, we should know but little about it.    We were disappointed at our ill success, at least Miss Belfield and I;  for the captain had anticipated that matters would be as we found them.  I, however, consoled myself with a determination I had formed, to raise  a monument of the victory a little more durable than the one which had  just disappeared. I made up my mind to compose a poem, an epic, on the  conquest of Bengal; Clive, of course, the hero, and Plassey the scene;  on which, like the combatants, I proposed to put forth all my strength.    I had for some days felt the stirring of the divine _afflatus_ within  me, a sort of boiling and rioting of vast ideas; too vast, alas! I  afterwards found, for utterance or delivery, for I stuck fast at  âImmortal Clive.â    Two or three days more brought us to the station of Burhampore. The day  before we arrived, Captain Belfield received a letter from an old  acquaintance at the station, one Colonel Heliogabalus Bluff, begging him  to breakfast and dine with him on the morrow, and pass a day or two _en  route_. The letter thus concluded:    âI hear you have your sister with you; shall, of course, be glad to see  the Beebee Sahib too; send herewith a _dolee_, which pray present to  her, with my _bhote bhote salaam_.    âA _dolly_, sir,â said I, in astonishment, on Captain Belfieldâs reading  this passage; âthatâs rather an odd thing to send: he supposes, I  presume, that Miss Belfield is a child.â    Captain Belfield was attacked with a most violent fit of laughter on my  making this remark, and I saw that I had been once more unwittingly  griffinizing.    When he had a little recovered his composure, âGernon,â said he, âit  will, add, perhaps, to your astonishment when I tell you, that we intend  to eat the said _dolly_ for dinner, and shall expect you to partake of  it.â    Saying this, he ordered the article to be brought in, when, instead of a  toy, I found the dolee was a basket of fruit, flowers, and vegetables.    âWho is the gentleman?â said Miss Belfield, as we sat at tea in the  evening, âfrom whom you had the letter this morning, and to whom we are  indebted for all this fine fruit?â    âWhy, Colonel Bluff,â said her brother, âan old fellow-campaigner of  mine, a very rough subject; âand though he is my friend,â as Mr. Dangle,  in âThe Critic,â says, I must acknowledge, a very eccentric and far from  agreeable character.â    âOh! pray describe him fully,â said his sister: âI like much to have an  eccentric character delineated, for, in this age of refinement, men have  become so very much like one another, that a person marked by any  peculiarity is as enlivening as a rock, or other bold feature, to the  sight, after having been long wearied by the monotony of a low and level  landscape: do, pray, give us a sketch of him.â    âWell, then, the colonel is a stout, sturdy John Bull, underbred and  overfed, combining with the knock-me-down bluntness of that character,  as it once existed more strongly than at present, and a double allowance  of all his ordinary prejudices, the _gourmanderie_ and frivolity which  an idle life in India is too apt to engender in the very best of us.    âHe reverses the rule, that we ought to eat to live, for he lives to  eat, and much of his time is occupied in devising dishes, or  superintending his farm-yard, educating his fat China pigs, and looking  after his tealery, and quailery and sheep.    âHe has a constant supply always pouring in for him from Calcutta, of  exotic and expensive luxuriesâbeer, champagne, pine cheeses, Yorkshire  hams, Perigord pies, pigsâ cheeks, and the likeâof which he is certainly  liberal enough; for no prince can be prouder than he is when at the head  of his table, making his gastronomical displays; in short, he greatly  prides himself on the surpassing excellence of his breakfasts and  dinners, though those who partake of them must often, as their price,  submit quietly to all his coarseness and brutality of manner. Folks in  India do not generally trouble themselves much about English politics;  at least, not so far as to identify themselves strongly with the sects  and parties which are everlastingly worrying each other at home, and who  remind me of vultures and jackals here over a carcase.    âColonel Bluff is, however, an exception to the rule, and has always set  himself up for a great church-and-king man, and a violent high Tory,  delighting in talking of such subjects. He is a terribly violent fellow,  and when excited by a few glasses of wine, pounds the table, and makes  the glasses dance again, as he denounces all Whiggery and Radicalism.    âWith all his faults, however, and he has more than an ordinary share,  he possesses a good deal of Miss Hannah Moreâs standing dish,  âgood-natureâ (provided he has everything his own way); and, indeed, but  for this redeeming trait, he would be utterly unbearable.â    [Illustration: Col. Heliogabalus Bluff and Orderly.]    Miss Belfield said she was curious to see this singular compound of _bon  vivant_ and politician, a feeling in which I expressed my hearty  participation.    âYou must be on your guard how you comport yourself before him, Gernon,â  said the captain, âfor I assure you he shows no mercy to griffins,  cutting them up right and left, when once he commences, with most  unmercifully rough raillery.â    âHe had better leave me alone,â said I, with rather a formidable shake  of the head; âIâm not under his command, you know, sir, and may give him  a Rowland for his Oliver.â    âYouâd better not attempt it, my dear fellow,â replied the captain; âhe  has demolished many a stouter griffin than you are.â    The next morning we reached the station of Burhampore, and a little  before we brought to, I observed, approaching the banks, a very stout,  burly officer, followed by an orderly sepoy, whilst a bearer held a  chattah, or umbrella, over his head. It was impossible to be  mistakenâthis must be Colonel Bluff.    â_Kisha budjra hyr?_â (whose boat is that?)    â_Bilfil Sahib ka_â (Captain Belfieldâs), replied a servant.    âShip ahoy! Belfield, get up, you lazy dog,â shouted the âstout  gentleman,â with the voice of a Stentor.    The captain ran out in his dressing-gown, and my suspicions were at once  confirmed; it was, indeed, the colonel; and a lively greeting now passed  between them.    âWell, then, so youâve deserted Javaâcut the Dutchmen, eh?âand come back  to the Qui-Hyeâs?âthey seem to have used you well, though; you aint half  such a lantern-jawâd, herring-gutted looking fellow as you used to  beâhaw! haw! You were, I recollect, when you joined us first, âas thin  as a haâporth oâ soap after a hard dayâs washing.â as my fatherâs old  north country gardener used to sayâhaw! haw!â    âComplimentary and refined, as usual, I see, colonel; I canât  congratulate you on any material alteration in that respect.â    âWhy, man, you donât expect me to compliment an old friend like you, do  you? âwith compliments crammed,â you know the restâhaw! haw! But, come,  stir your stumps, man! stir your stumps! breakfastâs all ready up  yonder, and as capital a ham for you as you ever stuck your teeth in. I  wait breakfast for no man, woman, or child living; you know me of old.  Talking of women, whereâs the Beebee? whereâs sister? sheâll come, wonât  she? My comptsâColonel Bluffâs comptsâglad to see her; always proud to  do the honours to the ladies. But who have you got in that boat astern,  Belfield?â    âOh, itâs a young friend of mine, Ensign Gernon, going to join his  regiment, under our convoy and protection.â    âO! a griff, eh! a greenhorn: hungry as a hunter, Iâll be sworn; bring  him along with you, bring him along, and weâll fill him out. Rare  fellows, your griffs, to play a knife and forkârare trencher-men. Iâd  sooner keep some of them a week than a fortnightâhaw! haw!â    âBut colonel, had you not better take your breakfast with us? itâs  ready, and then weâll walk up and spend the rest of the day with you.â    âBreakfast with you! No, hang me if I do: dâye mean to insult me, sir?  What! a man, after a voyage, with hardly a shot in his locker, ask a  gentleman on shore, with a Yorkshire ham on his table, to breakfast with  him! never heard such a proposal in all my life! No, come, come along,  or I must march you all up under a file of Jacks.â    All this, which I overheard very distinctly, and which was uttered at  the top of an iron pair of lungs, was intended for heartiness and  jocularity. No doubt there was kindness in it, and with mortals as rough  as himself, it might doubtless have answered very well; but the captain,  I could see, evidently winced under the infliction, though bent  apparently on enduring it for a season, with proper resignation.    After finishing our toilets, and a few other little arrangements, we  joined the colonel, who would take no refusal, on the bund or esplanade.    Captain Belfield introduced his sister and me. The colonel, on being  presented to the former, raised his hat, and made as much of a bend as  the sphericity of his form would allow; at the same time thrusting forth  a leg far better adapted (to borrow the corn-law phraseology) for a  âfixed dutyâ than the âsliding scale,â with the air of a finished man of  gallantry.    There was something so irresistibly comic in the momentarily assumed  suavity of this huge _Ursa Major_ (or _Ursa Colonel_, as Paddy would  say), this attempt at the easy movement of the ladyâs man, that I was  constrained to turn aside my head, in order to conceal a laugh.    The colonel gave us a superb breakfast and it was plainly observable  that his reputation as a _gastronome_ had not been overrated. Ham, fish,  jellies, butter, creams, cakesâall the profusion of an Indian  breakfastâwere severally the very best of their kinds; moreover, Colonel  Bluff gave the history of every article, telling us to lay on, and spare  not, as we should not meet with any like them between that and Mr.  Havellâs, the provisionerâs, at Dinapore.    The dinner was equally remarkable for its goodness and profusion;  Chittagong fowls, as big as turkeys, were there, and a saddle of mutton  cased with two inches of fat, on which the colonel gazed with as much  pride as some tender parent would look on a favourite child.    He had invited some eight or ten of the ladies and gentlemen of the  station to meet us, and it was soon abundantly clear that the captain  had drawn a most accurate sketch of his friendâs character.    After the former had retired, he began to let out a little more of it.  Seated at the head of his tableâhis burly King Hal person filling his  capacious arm-chairâfigure a little obliqued, a napkin over his knee,  and the bottles in array before him, the jolly colonel looked the very  personification of absolutism and animalism.    âGentlemen, fill your glasses! Church and King! and after that what you  will. Pass the bottle, Belfield; fill up a bumper; come, a brimmer; no  daylight, sir; none of your Whiggery here; I thought you had left all  that off?â    âIâll drink anything you please, colonel; but I fear our politics are  wider apart than ever.â    âYouâre not becoming a follower of that rascal Tom Paine, are you? I  know you used to dabble in all sorts of books, and were but a few  degrees off itâa republican, irreligious scoundrelâgone to the dââl, I  hope, as he deservesâa fellow that had no respect for royalty, and would  have upset, if he could, our holy religion, an infernal villain!â    âWhy, you are warm, colonel,â observed a middle-aged officer; âmay I ask  when you took so keenly to politics?â    âYes, you may ask,â said Bluff; âbut it depends upon me whether I answer  youâhaw! haw! Come, fill your glass and pass the bottle, and donât ask  questionsâhaw! haw! haw!â    Never did I see so rough a specimen of humanity. How he talked, laughed,  thumped the table, and laid down the law, in the exercise of his  unenviable immunity!    An incident occurred after dinner, which displayed in a strong light the  violence of Bluffâs character, especially towards the natives, and his  perfect disregard of the feelings of his company.    As the bottles were placed before him by the apdar, or butler, a very  respectable-looking bearded Mahomedan, something in their arrangement  displeased our host, who, pointing with his forefinger to one of them,  exclaimed, â_Yee kea ky?_â (what is this?)    The unfortunate domestic bent forward his head, though evidently in  fear, to scrutinize the damage, when he received a back-handed blow in  the mouth from the colonel, which rung through the room, and sent him  staggering backwards, _minus_ his turban, which had fallen from the  shock.    The manâI shall never forget itâstooped and picked up his turban;  replaced it on his noble-looking headâhis face was livid from a sense of  the insult; he put his hand to his mouth, and looked at it, there was  blood upon it.    The company appeared and were disgusted; even Bluff, I thought, seemed  ashamed of himself. Well it is that these things are becoming rare!    But enough of the colonel, of whom this sketch may give as good an idea  as a more elaborate description. Of such characters there were a few,  and but a few, in the Indian army, and it is to be hoped their number is  fast diminishing.                                        CHAPTER XXI.      We remained the following day, and accompanied the colonel, and one or  two of his officers, to a grand entertainment, given by the Nawaub of  Bengal, at his palace of Moorshedabad, in honour of the festival of the  _Baira_. The whole station had, I believe, received invitations, through  the Governor-Generalâs agent at the court of his highness, and a grand  spectacle was expected.    We left Burhampore, in a landau, in the afternoon, and after an  agreeable drive through a level and wooded country, partly on the margin  of a considerable lake, called the Motee Jheel, reached the city of  Moorshedabad, and entering a lofty gateway, found ourselves in the  enclosure or domain in which the nawaubâs palace is situated.    This building is a lofty structure, in the European style, on the banks  of the river, and bears the name of the _Aina Mahl_, which, if I am not  in error, means the âPalace of Mirrors.â    The whole scene was animated and striking, and particularly so to me,  being the first thing of the kind I had seen in India.    Groups of richly-dressed Mahomedans, exhibiting a grand display of  shawls, turbans and jewels; retainers and connections of the nawaub, or  dignified inhabitants of the city; armed men, attired in the picturesque  costume of the native soldiery of India, with shields, swords, and  matchlocks; Abyssinian slaves, and Bengalese in their flowing muslin  robes, constituted the native portion of the assembly. Amongst these  were a numerous body of English officers, in their scarlet uniforms, and  ladies elegantly dressed.    On the terrace of the noble house, overlooking the Baghiriti, stood the  nawaub and his little court, their jewels and muslins contrasting with  the plain blue coat and simple garb of the Governor-Generalâs agent and  other civilians about him.    Tables were laid out in the palace, profusely covered with wines and  refreshments, in the European style; old hands and griffins, fair sex  and civilians, seemed all determined to enjoy themselves, and to give  his nabobship a benefit; to sweat his claret, as a slight off-set to the  sweating his ancestors had given to ours in the Black Hole of Calcutta.    In the courts or pavilions below, Pulwahns, or athletÃ¦, exhibited feats  of strength; jugglers displayed their tricks, and two or three mimics  enacted the sale of a horse to an Indian Johnny Raw, a sort of Brentford  tailor, as far as I was able to judge from their action, expression, and  the applause they elicited from the bystanders, with great humour and  effect.    As night drew on, the whole place was illuminated, exhibiting a blaze of  light; the party, native and European, were congregated on the terrace  to look at the sports. A grand pyrotechnic display followed; the rockets  whizzed in the air, and the blue lights shed their spectral glare  around.    I was delighted: this is worth seeing, methought.    Anon, the river was covered with countless lamps in motion on its  surface, and, soon after, a fairy palace, or structure forming one mass  of gorgeous light, came gliding down the current, passing beneath the  terrace.    The whole effect was beautiful and striking. I have hardly ever before  or since seen anything of the kind which pleased me more.    The costumes and buildings of the East, and possibly of all  semi-barbarous countries, harmonize well with pageantry and spectacle;  all is in keeping, and nought appears to wound the sense of fitness and  congruity. Not so, it strikes me, in our own country, where the pomp and  glitter of the Middle Ages form strange patchwork with spinning-jennies  and the homely toggery of our utilitarian and go-ahead times. Fancy  going to a tournament by a railroad, or seeing a mailed champion riding  cheek by jowl with a Kennington ââbus,â or one of Barclay and Perkinsâs  drays. If we must have splendour, let it be in unison with the age.    The next day, having replenished our stores with several additions from  the colonelâs garden and farm-yard, for it would be ungrateful not to  acknowledge this liberalityâa truly Indian virtueâwe once more resumed  our voyage.    Burhampore, like most of the great military stations of India, is  intended to operate as a check on a large and important city; not that  from Moorshedabadâonce the capital of Bengal, a place long since sunk  into comparative insignificanceâmuch danger is now to be apprehended. It  is the head-quarters of a brigade, partly composed of European troops.    The barracks and officersâ quarters are superb, and form a vast square,  of which the former constitute the face farthest from the river; that  nearest to it is a continuous range of handsome houses and gardens, with  colonnades and verandahs, occupied by civilians and superior military  officers.    There are also other ranges of buildings running perpendicular to the  river, partly barracks and in part officersâ quarters. The whole is  separated from the Baghiriti by a broad bund, or esplanade. The sepoy  lines are about a mile inland, but the officers reside in the quarters,  or in the fine bungalows scattered about.    The scene here in the evening was very lively; soldiers exercising in  the square; officers riding on horseback, or driving in gigs; the band  playing on the esplanade; groups promenading; in short, I was pleased  with the place, and should have had no objection to have terminated my  voyage there.    The morning of our departure, we were besieged by the vendors of silk  piece-goods and handkerchiefs, as also of ivory toys and chessmen, for  both of which this place and its neighbour, Cossim Bazar, have acquired  a great reputation.    Some of the chessmen shown us were large beyond anything of the kind I  had ever seen before; so much so, that to play with an irascible man  with such ponderous and massive pieces might be unsafe.    The natives of India, it appears to me, though possessed of infinite  perseverance and ingenuity, have no natural taste (at least, if they  have any, it greatly wants cultivation); as respects progress in the  fine arts, they appear on a par with our Anglo-Saxon ancestors at the  time of the Conquest, and their sculpture, carving, and painting (and  probably their music), in their leading and more marked peculiarities  and defects, bear a considerable resemblance to those of such remains as  we have of the olden time of England. It is, however, probable that the  rude dawnings of knowledge are everywhere pretty much alike, though  marked with more or less of native vigour and genius.    Of perspective, proportion, &c., they know little or nothing, and of  this we had amusing examples, both in the carving and some pictures  which were here offered us for sale, and which latter, in the richness  of their colours and gilding, brought strongly to mind the illuminations  of old missals, except that, in the false perspective and utter  disregard of proportion, they beat them completely, outdoing Hogarthâs  illustration of that ludicrous confusion into which an ignorance of  these things is wont to lead the graphic tyro: full views at once of  three sides of a square building, flat roof inclusive, visible from  below; chiefs, in gorgeous apparel, seated on carpets as large as the  adjoining garden, and holding âposies to their noses;â antelopes  scampering over hills somewhat smaller than themselves; groups of  figures taller than the buildings, with dislocated limbs, and legs like  wooden stocking stretchers; water reversing the laws of hydrostatics,  and running up-hill, and objects increasing with the distance.    Miss Belfieldâs critical eye was shocked by these performances, though  otherwise amused; and for my part, I do not think I enjoyed a heartier  laugh since I was a griffin.    So completely vitiated is the native eye, by being accustomed to these  deformities, that the majority of Indians can often make little or  nothing of a European drawing; and I have often, in my post-griffinish  days, seen one of them take a pencil sketch in his hand, turn it round  about this way and that, and finally settle to its examination when  upside downwards.    The Hindus, in these respects, seem more deficient than the Mahomedans,  though, like the ancient Egyptians, in their ghauts, temples, and other  works, they exhibit the vast and minute in perfection, showing what  numbers and perseverance can effect without the aid of taste.    The Baghiriti, at Burhampore, narrows at the commencement of the cold  season to a moderately broad stream, and was now fast falling, so that  we were led to suppose some difficulty in getting into the great Ganges  at the point of junction, some daysâ journey higher up. Sometimes this  part becomes absolutely impracticable for large boats, which are then  obliged to effect the passage by another branch.    As we approached the great river, our journey became rather one by land  than by water. The river had fallen to the depth of a few inches in some  parts, we were pushed by main force, by our indefatigable dandies, over  sandy shallows, of miles in extent.    This was a labour, however, to which they had evidently been accustomed,  and most philosophically did they set about it: planting their backs  against the broad Dutch-built stem of the budgerow, they worked us along  by almost imperceptible degrees, with insufferable yelling, groaning,  and grunting, varied occasionally by the monotony of â_Tan a Tooney hy  yah!_â    After a _dos-Ã -dos_ing it in this style for some days, we had at length  the satisfaction to find ourselves fairly hacked out of the scrape, and  riding in the Ganges.    The Ganges! Strange were my emotions as I gazed on the broad expanse of  that famed and once mysterious river, with whose name were associated so  many of my early ideas of Brahmins, Gentoos, burning widows, and strange  idolatries! Alas! the romance of the world is fast departing. Steam,  commerce, and conquest, are making all things common, and soon they will  leave no solitary spot on this globe of ours where the imagination may  revel undisturbed amidst dim uncertainties and barbaric originalities.  There wants but a gin-shop on Mount Ararat, or a spinning-jenny on  Olympus, to complete the work of desecration.    A day or two more brought us in sight of the blue mountains, or hills of  Rajmahal, a great relief to the eye, after having been so long  accustomed to the unvarying level of Bengal.    The low lands at the foot of these hills are well stocked with game, the  neighbouring jungles affording them secure shelter. Everything is here  to be found, from the rhinoceros to the quail. Here I shot my first  chikor, a splendid bird, of the partridge kind, but twice the size of  ours.    Accompanied by the trusty Ramdial and Nuncoo, with a few dandies whom I  had pressed into my service as beaters, I sallied out one morning with  the determination to make a day of it.    After walking some distance inland, and to within a few miles of the  hills, I found myself in an extensive, flat, marshy tract, which had  evidently a short time before been covered by the periodical  inundations, to the depth of eight or ten feet.    This tract was covered with long coarse grass, a sort of reeds, which,  having lost the support of the water, were prostrated like lain corn.  Through these I was making my way, my beaters actively employed on both  sides of me, when, suddenly, a noble bird rose, with a rare clatter,  from under my feet; before I could cock my gun and close an eye, he was  at a good distance from me; nevertheless, being a fair mark, I fired,  and dropped him.    I was delighted, on picking up my sport, to find it a fine massive bird,  of the partridge kind, bigger than a red grouse; in short, as I  afterwards learned from the captain, the chikor[35] above described. I  reloaded and advanced; and in a few moments flushed another, which I was  equally fortunate in killing.    Immediately after the discharge of my barrel, and whilst standing on the  prostrate reeds, I heard a rustling, and felt a movement close to me. I  thought it was another bird, and cocked my remaining barrel, to be ready  for him; instead, however, of a chikor, an enormous boar, caked with  dried mud, and whom doubtless I had roused from a luxurious snooze,  burst forth almost from under my feet, to my very great astonishment.    His boarshipâs ear was most invitingly towards me; I had no time to  reflect on the danger of provoking such an enemy, in such a placeâno  rock, stump, or âcoign of vantage,â behind which I could have evaded his  charge, had he made oneâbut instantly poured the contents of my barrel  into his acoustic organ, at the distance of two or three yards. But the  fellow was almost as tough as the alligator, whose end I formerly  described: the shot produced apparently not the slightest effect beyond  a shake of the head and a quickening of his pace.    Away he went over the country, floundering through the mud and pools in  great style, Teazer, for some distance, hard on his heels, but with no  serious intention, I imagine, of catching such a Tartar.    Had the brute resented the earwigging I gave him, as he might easily  have done, a pretty little white cenotaph, on the nearest eminence,  â_Hic jacet Frank Gernon_,â and an invitation to the humane traveller to  drop a tear in passing, would have been the probable result.    After bagging one or two more chikors, I proceeded to the foot of the  hills, or rather of a spur proceeding from them, and soon found myself  on the skirts of a most tigerish-looking jungle: tall yellow grass,  sombre pools, with reedy margins, interspersed with irregular patches of  bush and tree jungle, ramifying from the densely-wooded hills above. I  would not have insured a cow there, for a couple of hours, for ninety  nine and a half per cent. of her value.    I paused ere I ventured to plunge into these dreary coverts; but my  hesitation was but momentary. It is an established fact that, in love,  war, or the chase, wherever danger presents itself,                              _Griffins_ rush in,                      Where _old hands_ fear to tread.    Besides, there were Teazer and the bull, and half a dozen black fellows,  _ready picked_, constituting long odds in my favour, even should a  hungry tiger appear.    In short, I entered, and was soon forcing my way, gun in hand, through  this most perilous locality, my heart in my mouth, and in a feverish  sort of tip-toe expectation that, in a second, I might find myself  hurried off, _Ã  la Munro_, by the waistband of my breeches.    Things stood thus, my party a little scattered, and all advancing  through the reedy margin of a winding piece of water (well stocked with  alligators, I had not the slightest doubt), when a shout, a yelp from  Teazer, a violent rush, a glimpse of some animal, an instinctive  discharge of my gun, and a huge hog-deer rolled head-over-heels at my  feet; all the work of an instant, into which was compressed as much  alarm (for verily I thought it was one of the royals) as would have  served (diluted into anxiety) for seasoning six monthsâ ordinary  existence.    Truly proud was I of my exploit, as the hog-deer, doubled-up, lay  kicking at my feet, in the agonies of death. By a fortunate chance, I  had lodged the whole charge of shot under his shoulder.    Never was griffin more elated. âWhat will the captain now say?â thought  I; âno more jeers or undervaluing of my sporting qualifications after  this!â    My first care now, after slinging the deer, was to get out of the  jungleâfor this successful feat had given a new relish to existence, and  I felt indisposed to run more risks. His legs were soon tied; a young  tree was cut, and thrust through them; and, supported by four men, I  proceeded in triumph to my budgerow.    âWell, Mr. Gernon, you have indeed been fortunate this time,â said Miss  Belfield.    The kind captain also congratulated me on my success, but warned me  against venturing on foot in such places again, as, in fact, I had  really incurred considerable risk. In return, I favoured them with a  detailed account of my whole dayâs operations.    The hog-deer, being a very bulky animal, served to feast the whole crew  and domestics, his throat having been cut when he fell, without which  operation no Mahomedan would have touched him. We also had some collops  of the flesh, which were tolerably good, though not to be compared to an  English haunch of venison.    I am not writing a book of travels, so shall touch but lightly on the  scenes and occurrences which presented themselves on our subsequent  route to Dinapore, where my friends and I partedâthey remaining there,  I, after a time, continuing my onward course to the capital of the  Moguls.    Hitherto, our route had lain through Bengal, a country of mud huts and  inundations; but we were now approaching a higher level, and one  inhabited by a finer race, living in a superior climate, and where the  Mahomedan spirit, which approaches nearer to our own, has imparted its  more enduring traces in the shape of substantial towns, and more  lasting, though still decaying monuments and edifices. Captain Belfield  had excited our curiosity by his account of the ruins of Rajmahal, the  some time transient capital of Bengal, during the reign of the Emperor  Aurungzebe, and we consequently indulged in pleasing anticipations of  the rambling and sketching we were to enjoy there.    It was evening when we approached that place; the sun was setting  gloriously on the Ganges as we moored our boats in a little bay near the  ruins, on one horn of which stood an old grey mosque, partially hidden  by tangled shrubs and jungle, and the tapering and feathery bambooâone,  perhaps, of the greatest and most striking ornaments of Indian scenery.    âWilliam,â said Miss Belfield, âyou must positively remain here  to-morrow, for I can never consent to leave all these fine old ruins  unsketched behind me.â    Her brother willingly consented to her wish, and a delightful day of it  we had, rambling, pencil in hand, amongst decaying mosques and  dilapidated palaces, where the voice of the imaun, or the sounds of  revelry, had long given place to the hootings of that mocker of human  vanity, the owl.    There are not, in the whole round of the feelings and sensations, any to  me so exquisitely, yet sadly pleasing, as those that arise in the mind  when we wander amidst the deserted courts of kings, and the monuments of  departed power and glory: how strongly do they link us with the past,  and how powerfully does the imagination, with such a footing, âbody  forthâ the things that were, but are not!    Captain Belfield, who, like his sister, as I afterwards discovered, was  somewhat of a poet, though in most things a matter-of-fact man, amused  himself, while we were sketching, in composing the following lines:â       _Lines on the Ruins of Rajmahal and the Palace of the Sungy Dulaun, some                         time the Capital of Bengal._               Ye mouldâring corridors and halls,               Which oâer the steep your shadows cast;             Ye ruins drear, which sad recall               The faded glories of the past:             Where the lone travâller pensive sighs,               And light winds pipe at evening hour,             Low blending with the lapwingâs cries,               The requiems of departed power:               How changed your aspect, since of old               Gay orient pageants filled your bound,             And trumpet and Nagara[36] told               Of regal state that reignâd around.             Here Sujah,[37] in his happier hour,               Poor victim of a brotherâs hate!             Enjoyâd the transient sweets of power,               Bright contrast to his darker fate.               Here Heavân displayâd its vengeful ire,               And Meerun[38] felt the fatal blow;             Here fell the retributive fire,               That laid the foul assassin low.             Where once the minstrelâs voice was heard,               Now nightly sounds the jackalâs yell;             There hoots the melancholy bird,               Grim cynic of the darksome cell.               Within the Haremâs latticed screen,               Where beauty once its radiance shed,             No bright eyes, save the owlâs are seenâ               The rank green jungle rears its head.             A carcanet of gemsâthe snake               Lies coilâd where jewellâd beauty prest,             Unwinding, seeks the tangled brake,               Or fierce erects his horrid crest.               Column and arch, with sculpture traced,               Crushâd by the peepulâs[39] circling folds,             Like writhing Laocoon embraced,               Art diesâand nature empire holds.             Hail, sombre fabric! type of life               Once gay and smiling, now forlorn;             Wreck of thyself, with ruin rife,               Of all thy first attractions shorn.               Like some volcanoâdead its firesâ               Here now no more the passions rage;             Ambition, hate, or fierce desires               Long pastâno longer conflicts wage.             Sadly thou breathâst the moral old,               Earthâs vanitiesâmanâs chequerâd lot,             By seers and sages often told,               In lifeâs fierce tumults soon forgot.               As oâer the mouldâring wrecks of time               With silent step we pensive steal,             In every land, in every clime,               Oh! say, whence spring those thoughts we feel?             Why hushâd the passions? touchâd the heart?               What prompts us all our state to scan?             What animates each better part?               Why breathe we love and peace to man?               âTis that awhile withdrawn from caresâ               Earthâs cares, with strife and sorrow fraught,â             Sweet contemplation lowly bears               Her treasures to the mint of thought.             In such a frameâin stilly tone               Waked fancy hears these words exprest,             âOh, pilgrim! this is not your home,â               Look upwards for thy place of rest.â    A tear trembled in Miss Belfieldâs eye as she read her brotherâs verses;  they had touched some tender chord, and the feelings they expressed were  evidently in unison with her own; she arose and retired to her cabin,  her head slightly averted, to conceal her emotion. As she passed, the  captain fondly stretched out his hand towards her; she seized and  pressed itâit was all the commentary she made.    The ruins of Rajmahal are not very extensive, nor are the buildings of  any extraordinary magnitude or beauty; nevertheless, some mosques, and  two or three old gateways, in the Moorish style of architecture, which  seems everywhere to have preserved its original characterâfrom Delhi to  Moroccoâare highly picturesque.    Captain Belfield, who was well acquainted with the place and its  history, acted as our Cicerone, pointing out the most remarkable  buildings; amongst these, by far the most considerable was the palace  erected by that crafty and most consummate villain Aurungzebe, of which  there are some very considerable remains, halls, baths, courts, &c.,  also the tomb of Meerun, the assassin of Surajah Dowlah.    Rajmahal was the residence and capital of the unfortunate Sultan Sujah,  one of the brothers of Aurungzebe. The tragic end of this prince,  amongst the wilds of Arracan, is touchingly related by the accurate  historian Bernier, whose history of this family is a perfect romance.  The relator has traversed the wild forests in Arracan towards Myamootie,  where the hapless Mogul prince is supposed to have met his fate.    There are Mahomedans naturalized in Arracan, who differ in many respects  from the aborigines, though they wear a similar garb. They are supposed  to be descendants of those followers of Sultan Sujah, who escaped the  massacre described by Bernier, and were retained in slavery by the  Mughs.    When the city of Arracan was captured by the British, the head of the  Mahomedan inhabitants, singularly enough, bore the name of Sujah. The  writer remembers him well, and a wily fellow he was, playing, on the  approach of the army, a well-managed double game, with British and  Burmese, which was to benefit himself, whichever party succeeded.    Poor Sultan Sujah! the howling forests of Arracan must have presented a  melancholy contrast to the marble halls of the palace of Aurungzebe!  Like Sebastian of Portugal (to whose fate his own bore some  resemblance), he was long believed to be alive, and fondly looked for by  his adherents in India, and several impostors appeared to personate him.    Rajmahal has long fallen from its palmy state, and what remains of the  town is ruinous, and thinly inhabited. Leaving this place, we continued  our route, having the woody ranges of hills on our left, at various  distances from the bank of the river.    At Sicrigully, a low spur of the hills touches the Ganges, crowned at  its eminence with an old mosque or tomb; beneath is a small bungalow,  for travellers, and hard by, a straggling village.    Here I was gratified by the sight of a brother sportsman, in the person  of an Indian hunter, or shekarri. He was a little, spare, black  creature, a native of the hills (a race perfectly distinct from the  people of the plains), armed with a matchlock, whilst sundry bags and  pouches adorned his person. He brought a fawn and a brace of jungle  fowls, which he offered for a rupee, and some English powder and shot.    The jungle fowl are the domestic cock and hen in a wild state, of which  there are many varieties in the East, though they are not often found in  the jungles far beyond the tropics. The plumage of the cock bird is  rich, varied, and beautiful, far more so than that of the civilized  chanticleer; the hens, however, are generally of a uniform dun or slate  colour, having callow bluish wattles, and spots of the same colour  around the aural orifices. These were the first I had ever seen, though  I had heard them in the Sunderbunds, and was not a little surprised to  learn from the captain that they were not only game, but capital  shooting also, and what to many may be considered a still further  recommendation, very good eating to bootâof this, indeed, we had next  day satisfactory proof.    So completely, however, are the cock and hen associated with scenes of  civilized life, so perfectly are the highly respectable couple  identified with man and his comfortsâthe stack and barn-yardâthat it is  almost impossible to fancy them wild, or still more to âmake gameâ of  them.    I recollect well, in after-times, the extraordinary feeling I  experienced on contemplating the first jungle cock I ever shot. I had  heard him sound his bugle-horn just beforeâa plain, matter-of-fact,  English _cock-a-doodle-doo_; and there he was, with his comb, bright red  wattles, and fine, curved, drooping tail, lying dead at my feet.    It required the full consideration that I was in a wild forest in India,  to convince me that I had not done one of those âdevilish deedsâ  perpetrated now and then at âIgate and âAmpstead, by adventurous gunners  from the vicinity of Bow Church.    These hills of Rajmahal, with their various attractions of scenery, wild  inhabitants, and peculiar productions, constitute a very pleasant break  to what many may deem the monotony of a voyage up the Ganges in a  budgerow; for many days they presented to me successive novelties.    One evening, our boats moored at a place called Peer Pointeeâa holy  saint, or _peer_, is interred on a neighbouring eminenceâand in the  evening, after sundown, the captain, his sister, and myself, took a  stroll, in order to pay our respects to the shrine or tomb of his  holiness.    To gain this, we had to ascend a low and rugged hill, on one side of  which, about half-way up, is an old mosque, with an arcade in front, a  pendant, doubtless, to the neighbouring durgah. The path was difficult,  but we soon found ourselves on the spot where the holy manâs ashes are  enshrined.    The tomb occupied the centre of a terrace, surrounded by a low wall.  Lamps burnt around it, if I rightly remember, and the attendant fakeer  told the captain, who communicated it to us, the legend of Peer Pointee,  and the cause which obtained him his present celebrity. The particulars  of the legend I have forgotten.    The fakeer assured the captain, that not only was the memory of the  saint venerated by man, but that it was also held in great respect by  the wild beasts of the adjoining jungles, particularly by the tigers,  one of whom came regularly every Friday night, and swept up the floor of  the durgah with his tail.    It happened that the day of our visit was the very one on which the  tiger was wont to perform this office; Captain Belfield told the fakeer  that he had a great desire to witness it, and had some intention of  sitting up for the purpose. The fakeer assured him, however, that it  would be utterly useless, for the animal had such an insuperable  aversion for all but true believers, that, if any other were near, he  would certainly not make his appearance.[40]    The next day we passed Puttergatta, a woody prominence, where there are  some caves, and a pretty white Hindoo temple. I went on shore to examine  them, and found Chattermohun Ghose paying his respects to a many-armed  god, with goggle eyes, and a vermilion mouth, seated far back in the dim  recess of a temple.    I have already hinted, that I had a regard for Chattermohun, so I  thought this a favourable opportunity for converting him to  Christianity, which I forthwith set myself about to achieve, breaking  ground by a few pungent sneers at his idol. I found Chattermohun,  however, a doughty polemic, and did not make the impression I expected.    âMaster will believe what masterâs father and mother have teach him for  true; Hindoo man do same thing. Sâpose I make change, then will lose  casteâno one ispek to me; this very had thing; too much for family man.â    There was no making anything of him; he was obstinate, so I gave him up.  I must not, however, omit one little incident, which my proselytizing  efforts elicited.    âMaster tell Hindoo religion got too many godâtoo much veneration for  image. Masterâs Europe religion have plenty god too.â    âWhat do you mean, you foolish fellow?â said I. âYou donât know what you  are talking about.â    âYes, sare, I know very well. I one Europe book got tell all about  that.â    To cut the matter short, Chattermohun afterwards showed me his book,  which was the Roman Pantheon, with cuts representing the deities of  Olympus!    Passing the two picturesque rocks of Colgong, which stand out in the  river, boldly breasting its current, we in due time reached the headland  of Sultangunge, opposite to which is the romantic islet of Junghera,  with its white temple and curious sculptures.    Here our budgerow was boarded by two sturdy beggars, who levy  contributions from all passers-by; one of whom was the Hindoo fakeer  from the rock, the other his Mahomedan _vis-Ã -vis_, of the main land,  ministers of rival creeds, but agreed on that point on which we  everywhere find an astonishing unanimity, the _auri sacra fames_.    The Mahomedan fakeer was a very venerable old man, with a long beard. He  was seated on a decked portion of the boat, a tiger skin spread beneath  him; a disciple in very good case, rowing the boat.    âMr. Gernon,â said Miss Belfield to me, the next morning, âthe scene of  yesterday has induced me to try my poetic powers. Here,â said she,  handing me a manuscript; âI have courted the Muse with somewhat more  success than you did at Plassey. Pray read this, and give me your  opinion.â                               EVENING ON THE GANGES.                 âTis eve! by Ganges palm-clad shore               Now lightly sounds the dipping oar,               As slow it breaks with sparkling gleam               The molten silver of the stream.               And list! a song, in fitful notes,               Soft oâer the tranquil current floats,               Mingling its cadence, as it dies,               With the lone hunzaâs[41] mournful cries;               (Sad cries, which, wafted on the gale,               Seem like some pensive spiritâs wail;)               The mÃ»llahâs[42] song, ere, toil-oppressâd,               He seeks his nook and evening rest.               Afar Jungheraâs rocky isle,               Crownâd by the tapering templeâs pile.               On rolls the sacred tide its course               Majestic from its mountain-source,               Afar in dim and mystic gladesâ               Which nought save pilgrimâs foot invades,               âMidst ice-bound glens, where, cold and lone,               Himaleh rears his snowy throne,               High over realms chaotic hurled,               The monarch of the mountain-world;               Whilst, far away, a sheeted throng               Of spectral peaks his state prolong;               Cold, death-like, mutes on high they stand,               Eternal natureâs pageant hand.                 Receiving homage as it goes,               Onward the mighty current flows,               Dispensing, as with regal hand,               Its bounteous blessings oâer the land:               Type of that power whose mercies flow               Oâer all this wildering scene below.               But ah! too oft its noble tide               By horrid sacrifices dyed,               Whilst bright self-immolating pyres               Shed oâer the stream their flickering fires.               Now from cool groves, whose mellow shades               No prying ray of light invades,               The low, fond cooings of the dove               Tell âtis the hour of peace and love;               And light-winged zephyrs gently play               Oâer the Mimosaâs quivering spray.               The setting sun its parting gleam               Sheds over Gungaâs sacred stream,               Which seems to blush as waning light               Consigns her to the arms of night;               And many a mosque and idol-fane               Reflect the crimson hue of shame,               Which slowly seems to ebb away               The vital tide of dying day.               By yon blue mountainâs brow afar               Now twinkles bright the evening star;               Translucent ray! the brightest gem               That decks its glittering diadem.                 Now deeper shades invest the shore,               The weary boatman rests his oar,               Glides slowly, that his eye may seek               The shelter of some friendly creek.               Abroad the night winds freely rove,               And countless fire-flies deck the grove.               Swift-winged brilliants! gems of light!               Bright jewels of the tropic night,               Than which the diamond of the mine               In richer lustre neâer could shine!               Now sparkling forth from nook and bay,               Long-scattered fires succeed the day,               And round them gathering, to their meal,               The dusky forms of boatmen steal,               Like wizard, demons of the wold,               Who round a pile their orgies hold,               Framing, on Scandinavian fell,               Some direful charm or potent spell.               The simple meal despatched, the song               And merry drum the joy prolong;               Or some light jocund tale gives birth               To honest bursts of simple mirth.               At length, the song and story past,               Silence profound succeeds at last,               By every sound unbroken, save               The turtleâs splash or rippling wave.               Thus by lifeâs woes and cares opprest,               The weary spirit sinks to rest,               And ebon pall and marble tomb               Invest the closing scene with gloom.                 But cease not thusâin sombre guise.                 As oâer that darkling stream               Another sun shall haply rise,                 To cheer it with its beam.               So, on the soul, its chastâning oâer,                 Shall burst eternal lightâ               The light that gilds that happy shore.                 Whose day shall know no night.    A few days more brought us to Boglipore, a very beautiful station,  surrounded by rich park-like scenery.    Having visited the boiling spring of Seetacoond, to which a plentiful  crop of legends is attached by the credulous natives, filled a few  bottles with the water, which is remarkable for its purity, and I  believe medicinal virtues (though, as I was not much of a water-fancier  at that time, I rather give this on report than from actual experience),  we soon reached the ancient fortress of Monghyr, a place which cuts a  considerable figure in Indian history, although more celebrated in  modern times as the seat of an extensive manufactory of tea-kettles,  turn-screws, toasting-forks, &c., as also of fire-arms, after European  models.    These guns have occasionally winged a few griffs, and have consequently  a bad name, though the vendors are willing to prove them in your  presence. Nevertheless, though dirt-cheap, they are not often bought,  except by the very green. There is no enjoyment in a suspected gun, any  more than in a doubtful egg.    On bringing to at the ghaut, we perceived a regiment of chapmen, all  eager to present their wares. One fellow carried a huge tea-kettle,  another a double-barrelled gun, a third a chafing-dish and a handful of  toasting-forks, a fourth a cage of beautiful green and blue birds from  the hills, &c.    With these gentry I drove several bargains, assisted by Ramdial, who  afterwards had to fight a few stout battles on his own account for  _dustoorie_, or customary perquisites, claimed, though unwillingly  allowed, on all disbursements in India.    A rare stock of valuables I had on leaving Monghyr, including three  cages of birds, one of avidavats, all swept off, some time after, by a  terrible epidemic, which found its way amongst them.    Here I observed, for the first time, a peculiar mode of capturing the  river turtle; several natives paddled a light dingy or canoe along, one  standing in the prow, with a light dart or harpoon in his hand;  presently I saw a huge turtle raise his head above the water, and in an  instant the harpooner flung his light weapon, having a cord attached,  which reached its object with an unerring aim; all was now bustle, and  in a few minutes I saw them haul in a turtle, which, as far as looks  went, might have made an aldermanâs mouth water.    As I am on the subject of harpooning, I may here mention a somewhat  similar mode in which the natives catch the mullets. These fish, the  most delicious and highly prized of the Ganges, swim in shoals in the  shallows, with their heads partly above the surface of the water: the  shape of which, by the way, and position of the large eyes, give them  much the appearance of serpentsâindeed, the first I saw, I took for a  brood of water-snakes.    The dandie, or fisherman, whoever the sportsman may be, follows them in  a crouching attitude, having in his hand a long light bamboo,  terminating in a number of unbarbed spikes, fastened on like the head of  a painting brush; and when within striking distance, he launches this  slantingly amongst the shoal, transfixing one or two fish, perhaps,  whilst the rest dive or swim off, and soon re-appear with their heads as  before, above the water, and slowly stemming the current. I used to  watch this operation with great interest, but could never make anything  of it myself, though I often essayed.    The fort of Monghyr is of vast extent, though the walls are now in a  decayed and dilapidated state; within the wide area are tanks,  bungalows, and some fine houses on rising grounds, commanding fine views  of the ruins, and the distant woods and hills, which latter here present  a rather bold and serrated outline.    A few days more, and we were gliding past the great Mahomedan city of  Patna, and in a short time after we found ourselves moored off the  military cantonment of Dinaporeâa second edition of Burhamporeâand the  station of a brigade of troops, European and native.    Here are two fine squares of officersâ quarters and barracks, with  numerous bungalows to the rear of them, somewhat similar in their  disposition and appearance to those at Burhampore.    Here, as I before mentioned, I was destined to part with my kind and  amiable companions, who were engaged to visit a friend at Patna for a  month before proceeding to their ultimate destination. Our leave-taking  was marked by unequivocal proofs that we had become dear to one another;  and both gave me little tokens of their remembrance.                                       CHAPTER XXII.      On the evening of my arrival at Dinapore, I was sitting on the roof of  my boat, observing the _dobees_, or washermen, thumping their clothes,  natives cleaning their teeth with primitive tooth-brushes of stick, and  other similar sights which diversify the animating scene of an Indian  ghaut, when the distant and inspiring strains of a full military band  broke upon my ear. âEgad!â thought I, âthereâs some fun going on; a  promenade, no doubt, with all the beauty and fashion of Dinapore  assembled; Iâll go and see.â    I ordered Ramdial to bring out the _jubba walla coortie_ (the laced  jacket), which had never yet graced my person in any public assembly. A  splendid thing it was, with a huge silver epaulet, and âtastily turned  up with a brimstone-coloured lapelle;â I thought there could hardly be  its fellow in all Dinapore. A neat white waistcoat, crimson sash (tied  in a _dÃ©gagÃ©_ knot under the fifth rib), coatee over all, hat a shade on  one side, and flourishing a clean bandanna in my hand, with a sprinkling  of lavender upon it, _me voilÃ _, an ensign of the first water.    I soon reached the scene of attraction in the principal square, and a  lively scene it was. There were congregated groups of officers, chatting  and laughing around belles seated in tonjons; others, three or four  abreast, promenading backwards and forwards, hands behind them, and  examining the structure of their legs; gigs and carriages drawn up,  their occupants attentively listening; syces walking their mastersâ  chargers up and down; chuprassies, silver-stick men, and other native  servants, mingled with the throng of sepoy orderlies and European  soldiers in undress.    I mingled with the crowd, and promenaded too; but, alas! I knew no one;  and who so solitary as he who, amongst a crowd, experiences the  sickening reflection that there is no one of the many assembled with  whom he holds the slightest community of thought or feeling!    The shades of evening were deepeningâthe assembly thinningâthe _finale_,  âGod save the King,â was playingâbusy memory had awakened thoughts of  those who did regard me, far, far awayâand I was waxing thoughtful and  sad, when I suddenly heard the sound of a familiar voice.    I turned, and recognized in the speaker my shipmate and brother-cadet,  honest Grundy. I sprang forward to address him.    God knowsâfor it is hard to answer for that fickle and selfish thing,  the human heart, which has rarely the courage to brave the âworldâs  dread laugh,â and follow its own more generous dictatesâwhether I should  always have done it with equal promptitude, for Grundy, in a mere  fashionable sense, was not an acquaintance to be proud of; but now I  stood in need of sympathy, and there are seasons when anything in the  shape of a friend is acceptableâwhen we are not fastidious, and are  overjoyed to exchange greetings with aught in the shape of humanity.    âGrundy, my boy,â said I, facing him, âdonât you know me?â    Grundy stared vacantly for a moment, for I was considerably  metamorphosed by my new habiliments; but soon recognizing me, his  features relaxed into an expression of good-humoured delight.    âOdds life, Gernon! is that you, man?â said he, grasping my hand; âwhy  whaur the dickens are you from?â    I soon satisfied him, and he told me he was now doing duty with a  regiment at Dinapore, and lived in a bungalow not very far off.    âAre you alone, Grundy?â said I.    âAlone!â replied my friend with a sigh; âoh, no; there are six of us in  the bungalowâGriff Hall, as they call itâall young hands, none of us a  year in the country, and a tearing life we lead; it does not suit me at  all, though, and I mean to leave them as soon as I can get another place  and a quiet man to chum with.â    âYes, I know your pacific habits, Grundy, and wonder how you got amongst  such a set; who and what are they?â    âWhy, thereâs first, Mr. McScreechum, an assistant surgeon; three  infantry ensigns, besides myself, and a Lieut. Fireworker,[43] of  artillery. I think they are all mad, particularly the doctor, for such a  man for mischief I never met with in all my born days. But, Gernon, lad,  I hope you will stay for a day or two, at least,â said he, slapping me  on the shoulder; âfor it glads my heart to see you again, man.â    I accepted Grundyâs invitation, and we proceeded to Griff Hall.    We found the doctor, with two or three others, on the _chabootra_, or  terrace, of the bungalow, all laughing and joking. The former, a huge  fellow, six feet two, with a freckled face and a carroty poll, in the  act of compounding a glass of brandy-and-water. Grundy presented me as  his friend on the way to join my regiment.    âGlod to see ye, sir; glod to see ye,â said the doctor, presenting me  his shoulder-of-mutton hand; âweâll use you weel at Griff Hall, sir, and  eeneetiate ye intoo oor Eleuseenian mesteries. Whatâs for dinner,  Larking?â said he, turning to a slender, pale youth, in a red camlet  raggie; âwhat have ye got for a treat to-night? Nae mair of your dââd  skeenny kid and tough goat mutton I hope. Ah! yeâr a braw chiel to cater  for a gentlemanâs mess.â    âIâll resign my post to you with pleasure, doctor, if not satisfied with  my proceedings,â replied the caterer; âbut I think things will be better  to-day, for I have given Rumjohn a good trouncing for palming that stuff  upon us yesterday. Iâll tell you what there is, doctor, by-the-bye, a  capital rooee muchee,[44] for I secured it myself this morning.â    âWeell,â said the doctor, âa rooee mucheeâs nae bad thing, if itâs  frash.â    At this moment, three more ensigns, inmates of Griff Hall, hove in  sight, rattling up on tattooes, or gallowaysâtits combining some  pleasant varieties of fiddle-head, goose-rump, swish-tail, &c.    In India, every one (_i.e._, European officer) must keep a piece of  horse-flesh of some sort or other, though it must be allowed that  griffins, for obvious reasons, were never remarkable for possessing  superior studs. As the new-comers approached, full canter and shuffle,  the doctor put forth a screech, compounded of an Indian war-whoop and a  view halloo, by way of welcome: the fun was evidently beginning.    One of the ensigns on the terrace jumped down into the road, took his  hat off his head, whirled it round, and hooted loudly, to make his  friendsâ horses bolt or shy. The doctor, too, seizing a sort of long  besom which stood in an angle of the bungalow wall, darted forward with  it to aid in putting the detachment to the rout.    âDoctor, what the deuce are you about, man?â shouted the immediate  object of his attack; âdonât be so infernally ridiculous.â    âStir him oop with the lang pole,â roared the doctor, nothing daunted;  âstir oop the bombardierâs wonderful animal.â    And so saying, he poked the besom under the tail of the tattoo, who  resented this rear attack by launching out his heels, jerked off the  Lieut. Fireworkerâs cap, and finally bolted, with his rider  half-unseated, across the compound, amidst the shouts and laughter of  his comrades, the doctor, with his wild red locks flying, and his feet  in slippers, pursuing him with his besom at the _pas de charge_.    McScreechum soon returned, puffing and blowing, and flourishing his  besom, and the Lieut. Fireworker shortly after joined the group, having  disposed of his runaway Bucephalus, but with a countenance darkly  portentous of mischief.    âDr. McScreechum,â said he, âIâll thank you, sir, not to take such  liberties with me in future, for I will not put up with them.â    âStir him oop with the lang pole,â said the doctor, still flourishing  his besom.    âOthers may submit to them, but I will not.â    âStir him oop with the lang pole,â again replied McScreechum.    All joined the medico in rallying the indignant lieutenant out of his  wrath. The good-humoured Scotchman brewed and presented him a glass of  grog, to allay the fury of âthe black dog,â as he termed it.    âA soft answer turneth away wrath,â saith the proverb, and on the same  principle, even a practical joke, though ever to be avoided, may be so  softened by a little tact as to allay the anger which, in nine cases out  of ten, it is sure to excite.    All these wild doings at an end, and matters properly composed, we  adjourned to the dining-room, being summoned by a rather dingy-looking  butler, or khanseman, very much resembling the worthy who has been  recorded in these pages as having so suddenly decamped with my  plate-chest.    Six wall-shades with oil glasses, a long table occupying the centre of  the room, and about as many chairs as guests, constituted the sum total  of the furniture.    In accordance with the almost universal custom of the military circles  in India, camp fashion was the order of the dayâthat is, each gentleman  had his own plates, knives and forks, and glasses, with a brace of  muffineers, containing pepper and salt, flanking the same; these last,  of every variety of size and shape, of glass, silver, or pewter, with a  corresponding variety of patterns in the cutlery and plates, constituted  as motley a show as can well be imagined.    The servants, too, were of the Rum-Johnny orderâa dissolute, dirty set  of Mahomedans, whom I have before describedâthose usually picked up by  young officers on account of their speaking the English language, a  qualification which is pretty certain to insure their rejection by old  Indians. The dingy attire and roguish looks of these fellows harmonized  well with the style of the entertainment.    The doctor took the head of the table; the noble fraternity of Griff  Hall and their guests were soon seated. The khanseman-jee appeared,  staggering under a huge dish, which he deposited at the head of the  table; having done so, he lifted up the cover with the air of a  major-domo, and there smoked the rooee muchee already mentioned.    âWhaâs for fesh?â asked the doctor, plying the fish-knife with the  vigour of an Irish bricklayer when handling his trowel. âWhaâs for fesh?  Hereâs a bonnie fellow; âa sight like this is gude for sair een,â as my  old father, the provost, used to say.â    The rooee muchee was in great request, and other viands followed, all  very good of their kind, I thought, and proving the efficacy of the  rattan in some cases. Great was the talking and laughing, and the dinner  sped merrily. Never has it been my lot to encounter a more  light-hearted, thoughtless, and jovial set of fellows than the inmates  of Griff Hall.    The cloth removed, hookhas bubbled; the bottle passed freely, and the  conversation became animated; among other things, the scenes and  flirtations at the band that evening were passed in review.    âWho noticed Miss Simper, the new spin, talking to that old fellow,  MacGlashum?â said Ensign OâToole, a young Hibernian; âsure I hope sheâs  not going to take that broken-winded old fellow.â    âBy my saul, I donât know,â replied Ensign MacClaymore; âbut I think if  she gets a major, and a gude Scotchman to boot, she could na do better.â    âFaith, I think sheâd find an Irishman suit her better than an old or a  young Scotchman aither: oh, an Irishmanâs heart for the ladies!â    âMeaning yourself, I suppose,â retorted the Highlander, dryly; âyou  Paddies think thereâs nought like yeerâsels in the world.â    âFaith, now, I donât think weâve half the consait of your Scotchmen, at  all,â replied OâToole, âthough a grate dale more to be proud of. Where  will you find janius like that which auld Ireland has producedâsuch  poets, statesmen, and haroes?â    âProud!â said the other contemptuously; âhooever may fall short in those  respects, thank Gude, auld Scotland was never conquered,ânever  conquered, sir, as some other countries have been.â    âIâll tell you the reason,â said the other bitterly; âthe poor beggarly  country was never worth the trouble and expense of conquering.â    âEh! sir,â said the young Caledonian, his eyes flashing fire, âwhatâs  that you say, sir? Iâll no sit here and listen to that. What do you  mean, sir?â    âMean!â retorted the other, sternly, âjust what Iâve said, Ensign  MacClaymore, and so just make your most of it; if youâve more to add,  let it be outside.â    Several attempts were made to check this angry dialogue, but in vain.  All was now confusion; the angry patriots half arose, and darted fierce  looks at each other across the table, their more peacefully disposed  neighbours endeavouring to quiet and retain them in their seats. Things  were fast verging towards âwar, horrid war.â    Dr. McScreechum now arose, like Satan in Pandemonium, thumped the table  to engage attention, and with the voice of a Stentor, proclaimed  silence, and called the belligerents to order.    âGentlemen,â said the doctor, âsilence if you please, and listen to me.  I am the moderator of this assembly, and by vairtue of the pooers  confided to me, I proclaim _pax_. Iâll have na quarrelling here; doun  wiâ your foolish naytionalities; arenât we all kintramen and brithers,  as my gude old father, the provost, used to say? You, Donald  MacClaymore, and you, Denis OâToole, Iâll fine you each a dozen of  claret, and proclaim you baith ootlaws of Griff Hall, unless you shak  hands, like sensible fellows; shak hands, ye fire-eating donnard deevils  ye, and then Iâll gee ye a sang. âAuld lang syne, my dear, for aâ lang  syne.â Whaâs for a sang?â This seasonable interruption, in the doctors  peculiar way, turned the tide of war. A furious drumming on the table  followed; glasses danced and jingled, and âAuld lang syne for ever!â  resounded through the hall. MacClaymore and OâToole caught the spirit of  the movement, shook hands across the table, and the glorious Scottish  air broke forth splendidly, like an elegy over buried animosities.    The doctor, half-seas-over, was now completely in his element; his huge  red head rolled from side to side, and one eye, half shut, leered with  Bacchanalian philanthropy around the table.    Thus he stood, his arms crossed, and holding the hand of each of his  right and left neighbours, as he worked them up and down with a force  and energy proportioned to the varying sentiments of that celebrated  ditty, which has to answer for being the proximate cause of more boozing  and maudlin sentimentality than any ever written; for oh, that potent  collocation of words, âfor auld lang syne,â goes direct to the exileâs  heart, particularly when softened by the genial glass; touches its  tenderest chords, and awakens, like the âRanz de vaches,â the sweetest  and most soul-subduing reminiscences of youth, and all its  never-to-be-forgotten associations.    After this bout, anchovy toasts and broiled bones were put in  requisition, Ensign OâToole insisted upon mulling a saucepanful of port,  to keep the beer and claret warm. At length, some fell asleep in their  chairs; others, including Grundy and myself, dropped off to bed, though  abused by the peep-oâ-day boys for our recreant qualities.    Away we went, heartily tired, leaving a few choice spirits to keep it  up, the doctor talking in thick and almost inarticulate tone about  âShesheroâs Epeestles to Hatticus.â    âYou may well be tired of such a life as this,â said I, next morning;  âit would kill me in a week; how do you stand it?â    âWhy,â replied Grundy, âI keep as clear of it as I can; besides, it is  not very often that we have quite such a jollification as we had last  night; however, the eternal racket we have does not suit me, and I shall  cut it as soon as I can; it goes against my conscience, too, to witness  some of the tricks they play upon one another. One day they hanged one  of the lads for fun by the punkah rope till he was black in the face;  and about a month ago sent a sub., a poor soft fellow, a voyage on the  Ganges in an open boat; and as he did not return for a week, it was a  mercy he was not starved or drowned.â    âHow was this, Grundy?â said I.    âWhy, the doctor and the lads were always poking fun at him, and making  him a _boot_ (butt). One night, something such another as last, they  made him believe he had been insoolted, and must fight. Sawney said he  would rather take an apology, but they told him it was quite impossible  that the affront could ever be washed out but with the blood of one of  them. They said it must be settled immediately, and went out with  lanterns to the back of the bungalow. The unfortunate lad was in a  dreadful fright, but they made him fire; the pistols were loaded with  powder only, but his antagonist fell; they said he had killed his man,  and must fly immediately, or, if he fell into the hands of the civil  power, he would inevitably be hanged. They hurried the poor young fellow  off the ghaut, put him on board a fishing-canoe, telling him to row for  his life till he came to some station, one hundred miles or so down the  river, where he would have a better chance of a fair trial, and must  give himself up. It was about a week before he was brought back to  cantonments, burnt as black as a tinker. There was a terrible kick-up  about it, and well there might be, for âtwas a cruel joke. The doctor  and all the parties concerned were threatened with a court-martial; but,  somehow or other, it all blew over.â    Pranks such as these are now, I believe, happily rare in India, as  everywhere else; but those who remember the country twenty or thirty  years ago will doubtless be able to recall many such manifestations of  boyish folly.    It is not desirable that youth should be converted prematurely into  thoughtful philosophy; care, in the ordinary course of things, will  come, soon enough, and need not be hastened; but I am an advocate for  its buoyancies being restrained within moderate bounds, that with it fun  should not be allowed to degenerate into mischief or cruelty, wit in  vulgarity, and friendly intimacy into coarse familiarity and practical  joking.    We breakfasted very late, and the tenants of Griff Hall dropped in one  by one _en dÃ©shabille_, evincing painful symptoms of the previous  nightâs debauchâred eyes, trembling hand, and glued lips. One took a  dose of seidlitz, another five grains of calomel, and as for appetite,  there was none.    These are a few of the early effects of intemperance; its ultimate  consequences are not so briefly described.    I remained but one day more at Dinapore, which was partly devoted to  reporting my arrival, _en route_ to joinâa measure enjoined on all  military voyagers, but not always attended to. I also saw the troops,  European and native, at brigade exercise, &c.; and in the evening  witnessed a tattoo raceâofficers riding their own ponies. This was a  very comical affair.    It was a little before sunset when Grundy, the Lieutenant Fireworker  (who had entered his pony), and I, walked down to the course, which is  situated a little behind the cantonment, being separated from it by a  dry nullah,[45] over which there are one or two bridges.    We found a great number of the inhabitants of the cantonmentâsome in  gigs, some on horseback, and others on footâassembled to witness the  sport.    There was a good show of ponies, some of them certainly ârumâunsâ to  look at, but, as was fully proved in the sequel, âdevils to go.â Long  tails and swish tails, stumps, crops, and wall-eyes were there in  perfection. The young officers who were to ride them, amongst whom I  recognized more than one of the inmates of Griff Hall, marched about in  their top boots and velvet hunting-caps, cracking their whips with  countenances expressive of the full sense they entertained of the awful  contest in which they were about to be engaged.    Some, too, tightened their poniesâ girths; others passed their hands  down their fore-legs, as if to rub out the knots and clean the back  sinews; some put their arms lovingly round their animalsâ necks, or  gratified their love of tormenting by pinching the flanks of their  steeds, and enjoying their abortive attempts to bite.    Amongst this throng was a very remarkable character, well known at  Dinapore, the clerk of the course, or whatever other name properly  appertains to the master of the ceremonies on such occasions. He was a  little, old, sun-dried, invalid sergeant, of a meagre form, but most  determined spirit. I was greatly amused by the consequential air of the  diminutive old fellow, as he stumped about in a rusty hunting-cap,  cracking a tremendous whip, and clearing the environs of dogs, boys, and  all other interlopers.    The time for the race having arrived, the young men mounted, some in red  jackets, some in white, and others in full jockey attire. The clerk of  the course ranged them all in proper order; eagerness was in every eye  as they bent forward, impatient for the word. Ladies stood up in  carriages, and many a neck was outstretched to catch a glimpse of the  start: when at last a thundering âReady,â âOff,â from the little  mummified sergeant, and away flew the tattoos, âPunch,â âCocktail,â and  âMat-oâ-the-Mint,â and many a nameless steed besides. Such digging,  spurring, and straining; such crossing and jostling as was there! one  pushing ahead for a space, and then another passing him, and so on!    When the whole troop had got about half-way round (it was a sweepstakes,  round the course), the leading pony bolted, and was followed by all the  rest, entering the gates leading to a bungalow, the first of a series  there commencing; there they very deliberately drew up, where doubtless  they had often drawn up before, when carrying their masters on their  rounds of morning visits.    Intense were the roars of laughter which issued from the spectators  assembled, occasioned by this little episode. Haul, dig, pound, and  spur, and they were again placed, and offâbut ah! the unlucky fates! the  meridian of another bungalow entrance no sooner reached, than away with  them again, follow my leader, like a flock of sheep through a gap, or a  string of wild geese.    I thought verily I should have died outright, and as for honest Grundy,  and many of my neighbours, they stamped and roared till the tears ran  down their cheeks.    All this time we could see, though the distance was considerable, that  the jockeys were hard at work, getting their tattoos once more under  weigh through the opposite segment of road leading from the attractive  bungalow, the other horn, as it might have been termed, of the dilemma.    The course regained, away they went once more: the struggle was becoming  warm; they had turned the curve, and were in a line with the  winning-post; bettors were now on the _qui vive_ââten to one on  Cocktailââthe little sergeant squatting bands on knees, taking a  judgmatical observation, when lo! no sooner had they reached a certain  bridge before mentioned, leading in a rectangular direction to  cantonments, than away they sidled, and at last one and all made a fair  bolt of it, right before the wind, for âhome, sweet home.â    âZounds!â said the sergeant, âif they beaânt all off agin, Iâm a  Dutchman.â    And off sure enough they were, amidst renewed peals of laughter. I doubt  if any race ever produced half the amusement. âThey are gone, they are  gone, and never will return.â    This was literally the case with some; but several of the heavy sailers  managed to tack, and came in amidst the half-mad shouts of unexpected  winners, proving truly that âthe race is not always to the swift,â and  that the best-founded expectations may be unexpectedly disappointed.    Two or three races on a smaller scale followed; but all was flat after  the _unique_ scamper I have attempted to describe; pleasure and  excitement had expended themselves, and were not to be renewed  immediately. Under these circumstances, Grundy and I bent our steps  towards the band, accompanied by the young artillery officer, who,  having proved the winner, was in high spirits.    Our dinner this evening passed off far more soberly than that of the  preceding one. The doctor was evidently suffering from a reaction of the  vital spirits, and on more than one occasion seemed disposed, like a  certain old gentleman when he was sick, to be religious and sentimental.  After a bottle or two of Hodgson, however, and a due proportion of  claret, he rallied, and proposed a round game at loo, as a mode of  passing the evening, which was joyfully assented to by the whole party.    The tables were consequently cleared, wine-glasses, &c., were placed on  teapoys and side-tables, and to work we all proceeded, keeping it up  till two in the morning, when I retired _minus_ a very considerable  pinch of General Capsicums âsnuff,â with a firm determination to cut  cards from that time for evermore: a resolution which I religiously  keptâtill the next time temptation came in my way.    At the time to which my Memoirs referâand I am not aware that any  material change has since taken placeâgambling was unfortunately too  prevalent in India. I have known nearly the whole of a small station,  ladies inclusive, keep it up for weeks, alternately at each otherâs  houses, rarely missing a day.    The party would assemble after breakfast, and having distributed fish,  and set pen and ink to write I O Uâs, would commence business in good  earnest. Tiffin would constitute a break, and after being rather  impatiently despatched, operations would be resumed, and continued till  time for the eveningâs drive. After this, and dinner over, another round  of this absorbing amusement would close the day.    What a world of bad feeling in men, of keenness and unfeminine  cupidity in women, have I seen elicited on those occasions, and what  studies for the curious in physiognomy; what expressions of various  kinds have I observed in the faces of the party, when the hour drew  near for inditing I O Uâs and settling the accounts of Dr. and Cr.;  what earnest pleadings for another round on the part of the losers,  and conscientiously-expressed determinations to retire to rest on the  part of the winners!    Cards and dice are pests, the offspring of idleness, and the parents of  vice and crime. They are the concomitants of semi-barbarism, and their  gradual disappearance is one of the indices of advancing civilization  and mental improvement. I began to think this one night after losing Rs.  1,100 at hazard and double-or-quits, and the impression has continued to  gain strength ever since.    Next morning, after breakfast, I bade adieu to Griff Hall and honest  Grundy; had my hand almost squeezed to a jelly by the good-natured son  of the provost, and, repairing on board my bolio, was soon once more  under weigh for the âfar west.â    Very different, however, were the feelings which now attended my onward  progression. I had lost my kind and pleasant Mentor, Captain Belfield,  and his amiable maiden sister. There were no more social rambles, no  more agreeable disquisitions, no more tours in search of the  picturesque, no more chess.    I felt how insufficient my own thoughts were to supply the _hiatus_  caused by their absence, and mentally ejaculated, as I occupied my  lonely cabin at night, with poor Alexander Selkirk,                      âOh, solitude, where are the charms                    That sages have seen in thy face?â    I cannot quit the subject of my two friends without saying a few more  words regarding them. I have already stated briefly that Captain  Belfield and his sister afforded a fine example of that tender  attachmentâthat perfect love and affection which should ever subsist  between persons so nearly connected. They truly lived for each other,  and the imparting of mutual pleasure seemed to constitute one of the  highest gratifications of their lives. It was quite refreshing to  observe the warmth and cordiality with which they met in the morning, as  she, the picture of neatness and refined simplicityâthe very beau ideal  of the real English gentlewomanâstepped from the sleeping apartment of  the budgerow, whilst he, closing his ponderous Sanscrit or Persian  folio, and laying it on the breakfast-table, would rise with extended  hand and a cheerful smile to greet her. Then at night, too, after the  short but fervent prayer to the Father of all, which the captain himself  would offer up extempore, how attentively would he light her taper, and  then with a tender salute commend her to her chamber and repose.    If two or three can love in this way, I have since sometimes thought,  why not all the world? but all the world, my good griffin, are not  brothers and sisters. True, true; I had forgotten that. The more, alas!  the pity.    Though, however, the hearts of the pair were thus united, there was not  an equal accordance in all their sentiments and opinions. This, however,  though productive of numerous discussions, never led to acrimonious  disputes. They agreed to disagree. Nature had cast the brother and  sister in the same mental mould, to borrow a phrenological term (which I  do with respect); the organization was equal. The same fine sense and  kindliness of disposition in both; but circumstances had favoured in  different degrees the development of their respective qualities.  Benevolence, veneration, and ideality must have been large in both,  though the captain had evidently been at pains to curb the vagaries of  the latter. He had left his home a mere boy, with his mind almost a  blank sheet, on which anything might have been inscribed. Whilst others  his contemporaries plunged into idleness and dissipation, he, by some  chance, flew to the solace of books. In them he studied that mystery of  mysteriesâman, comparing, as life advanced, the living manifestations of  his character with all that he found recorded of his acts; he perused  the works of historians, theologians, and metaphysicians, on all sides  of all questions; and arrived at one grand conclusion, which is, that  truth is a very hard thing to get at, and, like the ideal good of  Goldsmithâs Traveller, âallures from far, and as we follow, flies.â He  certainly sought it ardently, though he could not felicitate himself, he  said, exactly in having yet found the âtrue truth.â A self-taught  genius, who thought vigorously, and expressed himself strongly, he was,  no doubt, somewhat of an Utopian; at least such I know Captain Marpeet  thought him.    Miss Belfield had been reared in the elegant seclusion, but subject to  the somewhat contracting influences of an English country life (nature,  if I may so express it, seems to have intended nations as well as  individuals to be gregarious), enjoying in her fatherâs pretty vicarage  her pets, her flowers, and the agreeable and polished society of the  superior gentry of the vicinity. In the neighbouring village she  dispensed her little charities, assuaged the sorrows of the poor and  needy, and did all the good she could in her limited sphere; but of the  sufferings of the world on a grand scale she knew not much, and as  little understood, perhaps, their real causes and remedies. High as were  her qualities of heart and intellectâand admirably would she write and  speak on all matters on which she allowed them free scopeâshe was not  (and who is?) without a defect; hers was one frequently to be met with  amongst the most amiable and estimable of our countrywomen, a gentle  intolerance and quiet assumption of infallibility on those subjects on  which a very little reading and reflection ought, perhaps, to convince  us that we should hold our opinions with the most trembling diffidenceâI  mean religion, and other kindred subjects relating to the powers and  duties of mind, and the great interests of society, but particularly the  former. This would evince itself in the expression of extreme pity and  commiseration for the obstinacy or delusion of those who conscientiously  differed from her in such matters, she, by her manner, never seeming to  entertain the smallest shade of suspicion that she herself might be in  error. This spirit, partially veiled by the graces of her manner, the  kindness of her heart, and the evident rectitude of her intentions, did  not look so ill as the ugly monster intolerance generally does; still it  was her dark side, and but ill accorded with the general good sense by  which she was characterized; her reading on these points had been as  exclusive as her brotherâs had been general.    Equally holding to certain fundamental points, they were both anxious to  regenerate mankind, but were widely opposed in respect to the means to  be employed for that purpose. The captain looked primarily to schools,  lectures, locomotion, and the wide diffusion of commerce and  intelligence, and thought if man fell by eating of the tree of  knowledge, he figuratively was destined to rise by a repetition of the  act. Miss Belfield principally relied on the multiplication of churches  and Sunday-schools, the extension of missionary labours, the early  conversion of the Jews, and the like. He thought that religion was the  first subject to which an instructed mind would direct its attention.  Miss Belfield, on the contrary, considered it the very last on which, if  not forced upon him, he would seek to be informed. She considered man as  radically vicious, that suffering was necessary to try him, and that it  was perhaps better to preach resignation to evils, than to waste time in  vain attempts to diminish them materially. Her brother differed, too, in  this, and thought that happiness was quite as well calculated to fit us  for heaven as misery; and that it was almost a libel on the Deity to  suppose that the thanks and praises of a rejoicing heart would not be as  acceptable as those emanating from one bowed down by sorrow and  suffering. He thought that the evils inseparably annexed to our  condition, such as death, sickness, and the loss of those tenderly  beloved, were trials sufficient, without our unnecessarily increasing  the load by fictitious onesâclearly the result of our follies,  contentions, and prejudices.    He used to compare society, as at present constituted, to a body of  undisciplined troops, composed of jarring detachments, under incompetent  leaders, and amongst whom the finest military qualities and powers are  neutralized or impaired by want of concert and organization.    âEducate your masses,â he would say, âfor without you do that no  conceivable form of government will produce happiness to the governed.  Construct the finest piece of mechanism you may, on the strictest  principles of art, if the material is rotten and unsound, it must give  at some pointâthe due antagonism of its springs will be destroyed, and  it will not work.â    This diversity of views, which I have endeavoured to describe, used to  give rise, as I have already stated, to numerous animated discussions.    I used to listen to these collisions of intellect, during the evenings  we passed together, with much interest; and when I could see my way  through the _pros_ and _cons_, was wont sometimes to venture an opinion,  to which the captain and his sister always listened with eagerness, as  if anxious to know how the matter would strike on my young and  unsophisticated mind.    Some of these discussions, that is, the substance of them, I still  remember, and had I space, and were this the place for them, I might  here be tempted to record.    Lest my reader may be inclined to think otherwise, I must here state, in  justice to the good captain, now no more, that he was no leveller; he  considered perfect equality as impracticable as to construct a perfect  column without a base and a capital, and that the fabric of society must  ever fine away to a point, but that instead of being, as at present,  founded, in great part, on misery, prejudice, indigence, and ignorance,  it might be made to rest on the solid basis of virtue and happiness.    His grand axiom wasâand he used frequently to repeat it to his  sisterââIf by reading, observation, and reflection, I have learnt  anything respecting my fellow-creatures, it is this: that eight-tenths  of their sufferings have been and are entirely of their own creation,  and that it is within the powers of the human mind to diminish the  amount of moral and physical evil to an incalculable extent. The upper  classes appear to govern the world, but in reality it is the ignorance  and prejudice of the âtyrant majorityâ which rule it. In these, the more  educated find what physically Archimedes soughtâthe fulcrum to move the  world: the head is the governing part of the body, but we all know how a  disordered stomach will affect it.â    I had but little more intercourse with the good captain and his sister  during my stay in India, though we met now and then, and maintained an  occasional correspondence. He, poor fellow, was never destined to  revisit his native land, for after saving a small competence, and just  as he was preparing to return, death, by one of its most appalling  agentsâcholera-lodged a detainer against him, and instead of enjoying  the easy evening of life he had fondly anticipated amongst the scenes of  his boyhood, he was destined to fill a cold tenement, six feet by two,  in St. Johnâs churchyard, Calcutta.    âTis not for me to describe Miss Belfieldâs feelings on this occasion;  indeed, who can describe the anguish of heart, the utter desolation,  which the loss of a brother or a sister, endeared by union of sentiment  and every tender association of youth, necessarily occasions? I learnt  that she almost sunk under the blow; and a few, very few lines, which  she wrote me shortly after, told forcibly the extent of her sorrows, and  indicated the gratifying fact that she considered I had a right to  participate in them.    Well, years rolled away. I returned home, with a broken constitution,  and a _lack_ of rupees, in the English sense of the term;[46] and some  time after that event received the following letter:â                                             âSwines-Norton, June 10th, 18â.      âMY DEAR CAPTAIN GERNON,      âI have for some time been aware of your return to your native land,    having heard of you from mutual friends. Pray, when your avocations    will allow of your leaving London, endeavour to visit my retirement. I    have a small room in my cottage at your service, and shall enjoy great    pleasure, in some respects a sorrowful one, in meeting you again, and    in reviving old recollections of those days when first we became    acquainted. I will reserve all further communications till we meet; in    the meantime am,                                              âMy dear Captain Gernon,                                                        âYours most truly,                                                            âA. BELFIELD.â      âTo Brev. Capt. Gernon,        â5, Peppercorn-buildings,            âPimlico.â    I was not long in finding out Miss Belfieldâs retreat. The Highflyer  coach dropped me at the Bull, a foaming, rampant fellow, the only thing  evincing any signs of life and animation in the small sleepy village of  Swines-Norton, in ââshire. A few smock-frocked clowns, a bandy-legged  ostler, and a recruiting-sergeant, who seemed wofully out of his  element, loitered in front of the little inn as I descended.    âWhat luggage had you, sir?â    âNothing but a small carpet-bag.â    âCome, Bill, bear a hand, and get the gentlemanâs bag out of the hind  boot.â    The bandy-legged ostler soon disengaged my property; the spruce bluff  coachman clutched his reins and cracked his whip, and made the  over-frisky off-leader dance a saraband.    âHas Davy brought up that there black mare?â said the landlord,  sauntering out with his pipe and tankard of half-and-half.    âYes; heâs down there along oâ Tom at the Blackbird.â    All rightâcrackâwhispâa nod to the pretty chambermaid at the  windowâya-hip! and away bowled the Highflyer, leaving me âalone in my  glory,â saving and except the drowsy specimens of humanity  afore-mentioned.    âCan you tell me where a lady named Miss Belfield resides?â    âMiss BulfieldâMiss Bulfieldâbe that she, Jem, as lives furder end oâ  Tinker-pot-lane?â    âThe lady, I mean,â said I, âreturned from India some years ago, and  resides in something cottage, but I have forgotten the name.â    âAll right, sir, thatâs sheânow you mentions the Heast Hinjies. I knows  sheâve a-got a parrotkeetâjist go on to the church, and then turn to  your right hand, and keep straight on as ever you can go âtil you comes  to a lane; when you be at the top oâ that, get over the stile and go  across the footpath till you comes to the furder end oâ the field, and  then anybodyâll tell you where Myrtle Cottage is.â    âThank you, my man,â said I.    And I forthwith set out on my voyage of discovery. It was a sweet  summerâs evening, glorious, tranquil, sad. I heard with delight the  cuckooâs voice, the tinkle of the sheep-bell, and the cry of the  jackdaws, as they sported about the burnished vane of the old  weather-stained steeple. I was in no hurry, but loitered in the quiet  village churchyard, where naught was moving save some two or three  little ragged sheep; and oh! who could describe the sensations, the  sadly pleasing, confused, but undefinable sensations, which crowded upon  me during the little half-hour that I spent there?    Seated on an old grey tombstone, alone, and looking up at that rustic  monitor, the village clockâwhilst the soft summer air played on my face,  and soothing rural sounds fell on my earâthe events of my past life, the  images of friends departedâall I had done and left undoneâpassed like  visionsâdissolving viewsâbefore me. Brother Indians, try sometimes,  after your period of toil is oâer, the effect of a summerâs musing in a  rural churchyardââtwill calm the perturbation of your spirits, place  things in their true lights before you, and act as oil on troubled  waters. But, to be brief, I found Miss Belfieldâs cottageâneat, modest,  elegant, and retiring, just as I remembered herself. The parrot screamed  in the little hall, and a very antiquated dowager of a spaniel, with an  opaque eye, emitted a husky bark as I entered.    âBe pleased to take a seat, sir,â said the tidiest and modestest of  little maids, âand my mistress will be with you immediately.â    I took a seatâmy spirits were in a flutter, almost bordering on pain.  The door opened, and the hand of Miss Belfield was locked in mine. We  both started a little.    âMost truly glad to see you,â said she, with deep emphasis, her eyes  full of tears. I placed my other hand over the one of hers which I held  in my grasp, and answered her by a soft and earnest pressure, which told  how deeply I reciprocated the feeling.    âWell,â said she, smiling, after a pause, âI suppose we must not  compliment each other on looks, for I am almost afraid to think how long  it is since we partedâbut I hope our mutual regard has not suffered by  the lapse of time.â    I assured her that my respect and esteem for her were as fresh as ever.  Years and ill-health had given me a slight curve in the shoulders. The  freshness of my complexion had long been converted into a delicate  yellow; my hair was grey beyond the power of Macassar oil to restore,  and crowsâ feet had dug their ineffaceable marks at the angles and  corners of my face.    Miss Belfieldâs eyes I once or twice caught resting on me, as if  involuntarilyâfor she instantly averted them on their encountering mine.  She was doubtless comparing me to my former selfâand exclaiming  inwardly, âOh! what a falling off is here!â    If she was struck by my changed appearance, I was no less so with hers.  Time and Care, rival ploughmen, had deeply furrowed her browâher  _embonpoint_ was gone; and the iron-grey locks peeped here and there  through the muslin of her cap. Still, as of old, the ease, the urbanity,  the refinement, and, at the same time, the simplicity of the  gentlewoman, shone in Miss Belfield as conspicuously as ever.    As we stood near the fire, and during the pause which followed the  ardour of question and answer incident to a first meeting, Miss Belfield  drew my attention to a portrait over the mantelpiece; it was that of an  officer, in somewhat old-fashioned regimentals.    âDo you know that?â said she, in a subdued and choked tone, pointing to  it with her finger.    I did indeed; âtwas my old friend, the good, the kind, and thoughtful  captain. There he sat, serenely, with his book half-opened and resting  on his knee, just as he was wont to look in days of yore, when I rattled  into his budgerow, after one of my shooting excursions.    âCome,â said Miss Belfield, gently withdrawing me from its  contemplation, âlunch awaits us in the next room, and you must require  refreshment.â    I must reserve a more detailed account of Miss Belfield for some future  part of my autobiography,âthat devoted to England; let it here suffice  to state, that after a weekâs visit to my amiable friendâone  characterized by every thing that was pleasingâI returned to London,  having first promised to repeat my visits from time to time, to draw and  botanize, and talk of old times; and settle, over a cup of Howquaâs  mixture, the great questions now agitating the world. But to proceed.    I passed the old fort and station of Buxar, where a few invalids doze  out the evening of their Indian existence, and saw some European  veterans, almost as black as the natives, with large mushroom hats,  bobbing for fish on the banks of the river, and in due time reached  Ghazepore, the station of one of H.M. regiments.    Here I found my shipmate, Ensign OâGorman. The ensign, on whom I called,  received me as an Irishman and a British officer in the royal service  might be supposed to do. Could a volume say more for its warmth and  cordiality? I dined with him at his mess, at which urbanity, kindness,  and good cheer combined their attractions to render this one of the  pleasantest evenings I had spent in India. Oar ship adventures were  discussed; our fellow-passengers were passed in review, and we were  supremely happy.    âBy the way,â said I, rather carelessly, âhave you heard what has become  of Olivia Jenkins?â    âOh, didnât you hear she is married?â    âMarried!â I exclaimed, and a mouthful of pillaw stuck _in transitu_ in  my Åsophagus, nearly producing a case of asphyxia.    âGood heavens! you donât say so?â    âOh, itâs a fact,â said OâGorman; âbut whatâs the matter? you appear  unwell.â    âOh, I am quite well,â said I; âbut letâs take a glass of wine.â    I tossed off a bumper, and felt relieved.    âAnd soâlittleâOliviaâJenkinsâis actuallyâmarried? Good heavens! only  think of that!â    âWhy, sure,â said the ensign, smiling, âthereâs nothing very strange in  a pretty girl getting married; but,â added he, looking hard at me, and  after a pause, âI suspect you were a little touched in that quarter  yourself; am I not a true diviner?â    âI acknowledge it,â said I; âI did like that girl. Good heavens! and so  little Olivia Jenkins is actually married!â    The ensign pressed me to stay with him a week, but I was forced to  decline his hospitality, and resumed my onward route the next morning.    In a few days I reached BenaresâKasi, the splendidâthe Jerusalem or  Mecca of the Hindoo world. What a treat to look upon a picture of human  existence, just as it probably was when Alexander the Great was a little  chap!    As I glided past the swarming ghauts, where the pure-caste damsels, the  high-born Hindoo maidens, of this strange and antique land, displayed  their lovely forms, and laved their raven tresses in the sacred stream;  where the holy bramin and the learned pundit, seated cross-legged,  marked with ashes and pigments, pattered their Veds and Purans, I felt  this in all its force; whilst the blowing of the conch, or the tinkling  of bells, announced the never-ending round of _Poojah_ and devotion!    Here and there, the sacred Bull of Siva, and the _yoni_ and _lingam_,  festooned with wreaths of lotus or chumbalie, met the eye; whilst  crowded boats, jingling bylies (ruths or native carriages), armed  natives in the varied costumes of India (here assembling in the common  centre of religious hopes and duties), with an elephant or two  half-immersed, would serve to complete the foreground of this  interesting picture.    Behind arose, somewhat after the manner of those congregated  architectural masses in Martinâs pictures, though of course inferior in  the boldness of their proportions and general taste and magnificence of  the outline, the closely-wedged masses of this most curious and  old-world city; the continuity of buildings occasionally broken by  masses of foliage, or a cuneiform temple, with its tapering bamboo and  blood-red pennon.    High over all, in the centre of the city, on a natural eminence, towered  the celebrated mosque of Aurungzebe, with its two lofty minarets, which  command a magnificent prospect of the surrounding country. This mosque  is erected, it is said, on the site of a Hindoo temple of great  sanctity, which was previously desecrated by having the blood of a cow  sprinkled over it.    When the Mahomedans and Hindoos have a serious flare-up, the cows and  pigs are pretty sure to suffer for it. The one is held in the highest  veneration by the Hindoo, the other in utter abomination by the Moslem;  consequently, the killing of one in a mundil, and of the other in a  mosque, in pursuance of the _lex talionis_, generally constitutes the  crisis of a religious dispute.    Such is revenge, when passion and fanaticism are in the ascendant, and  such the _gusto_ with which, by contending religionists, the stab is  given in the most tender and vital part.    Having nearly cleared the city, I landed, accompanied by Ramdial Sirdar,  to take a peep at the interior of this strange place; and strange,  indeed, I found it. Streets swarming with people, and some so narrow  that one of our draymen could hardly work down them, unless edgeways.  Here, in the crowded chowks, waddled the huge braminy bull, poking his  nose into the bunyahâs grain basket, in disdainful exercise of his  sanctified impunity; whilst byraggies, fakeers, pundits, and bawling  mendicants, and much more, that I cannot here describe, made up a scene  as curious in itself, as striking and interesting to me from its  novelty.    In the course of my ramble, Ramdial gave me to understand that, if I was  desirous of an _hummaum_, or bath, after the Indian fashion, I could  have one at Benares for a rupee or two, which would purify my outer man,  besides being wonderfully agreeable. I had heard much of such baths in  the âArabian Nights,â and in works of the like sort, and thought this a  good occasion to compare facts with early impressions; in short, I  determined to be parboiled, and having intimated the same to Ramdial, I  departed with him and my kidmutgar, after an early dinner, to the  _hummaum_, or Ghosul Kaneh.    This was a considerable distance from my boat, in a garden, in the  outskirts of the city. We entered the building, and Ramdial having  explained who I was and what I wanted, an attendant of the bath showed  me a small apartment, in which I was requested to disrobe. Having  _peeled_, a pair of curwah drawers, or _pajammas_, were given to me,  which descend about half-way down the thigh, and are tied in front with  a string.    All being ready, I, rather nervous, submitted myself to the guidance of  an athletic native, similarly habited to myself.    We passed through a narrow dark passage, and I began to look out for  adventures. The slave of the bath showed me into a little confined  apartment, some ten feet by four, filled with steam, on one side of  which were reservoirs of water of different temperatures, in separate  compartments, about (as well as I can recollect) breast-high.    Here I found another attendant, who, after sluicing a bowl or two of  water over my body, laid me out on a long board, occupying the centre of  the narrow apartment, and, aided by his companion, commenced rubbing me  with soap and pea-meal from head to foot.    This over, they proceeded to rub me down slowly with _keesahs_, or rough  gloves, bringing off flakes and _rouleaus_ of cuticle and epidermis  astonishing to behold. Flayed alive, they proceeded to shampoo and knead  me, producing the most pleasing and grateful sensations.    The strong man now bade me rise, and then and there began to play the  castanets on my vertebral column, beginning at the topmost articulation;  this he effected by placing his leg behind me, swinging my body gently  backwards and forwards, and then by a sudden jerk, the very reverse of  pleasant, producing the desired dislocation and its accompanying crack;  having done with the spine, he rung the changes on my toes, knees, and  fingers. To effect all this, he entwined his brawny limbs about me in a  most gladiatorial style, which was far from agreeable.    At length, after a few more sluicings, I was given to understand that my  purifications were at an end; something was then thrown over me, and I  was led back to the place from whence I came. There I dressed, and never  in my life experienced such a feeling of purity and buoyancy. I felt as  if a new man, cleansed mentally and bodily, and ready to open a fresh  account with the world.    My kitmudgar, Fyz Buccas, a worthy little fellow, had not been idle or  inattentive to my comforts during my absence; for no sooner had I  dressed, and was giving the last shake to a clean cambric  handkerchiefâthe _finale_ of the toilet in Indiaâthan he presented me  with a cup of hot coffee, which he had prepared outside, and brought in  afterwards my kalioun, which I had recently set up; taking this then in  my hand, and putting the mouth-piece between my lips, I stretched out my  legs, leaned my head back, and, half-closing my eyes, immediately  departed for the seventh heaven, in a cloud of odoriferous incense.    The following day brought me to Sultanpore, the station of a regiment of  native cavalry, about midway between Benares and Chunarghur. Here I  stayed a few days with a cornet, to whom I was the bearer of a letter.  There are no native cavalry lower than this in the Bengal presidency;  these, consequently, with the exception of the Governor-Generalâs  body-guard (who are differently attired), were the first I had seen of  that arm.    On the whole, this body of black dragoons pleased me well; their dress  was French grey, buckskin breeches, and long military boots, with high  blue mitre-shaped caps, terminating at the apex with a sort of  hemispherical silver knob; those of the native officers were covered  with red cloth, with silver mountings.    The European officers wore helmets (since changed to shakos), but in  other respects were dressed like their men. Some of the troopers were  tight, well-made fellows, and the native officers large, portly  gentlemen; but, if I may be allowed a pun, should say there were more  _Musulmans_ than _musclemen_ amongst them.[47]    Europeans in general _peel_ much better than natives, though the latter,  being generally taller and more equally-sized, look better, I think, in  a body; nevertheless, amongst the sepoys are frequently found men,  models of symmetry and muscular vigour, with whom few Europeans would be  able to cope. Their great degree of strength is, however, in general,  artificially induced by the continued practice of gymnastics, the  _magdas_, or clubs, and the use of the iron-stringed bow, &c.    I arrived at Sultanpore during the great Mahomedan festival of the  _Mohurrum_, and the cantonment, neighbouring bazaars, and villages, were  resounding with firing and shouting.    This festival, as is pretty well known to all in any degree acquainted  with Oriental history, is held in honour of the martyrdom of Hussain and  Hosein, the sons of Ali, who fell on the fatal field of Kerbela, a  catastrophe beautifully told by Gibbon, and which even he, who attaches  no belief to the pretensions of Mahomed, can hardly peruse without  emotion.    If such are the feelings of the infidel, what must be those of the  believer? The _Sunni_ makes it a season of silent grief and humiliation,  whilst the _Sheahs_, or followers of Ali, abandon themselves to the  wildest and most passionate demonstrations of sorrow.    _Tazeahs_, or representations of the shrine of Kerbela, of all sizes and  shapes, more or less richly adorned with gilding, &c., are borne daily  in procession for a period of many days, followed by crowds of the  faithful, shouting âHussain! Hosein!â beating their breasts, and  indulging the most violent semblance of grief.    My friend, the cornet, drove me out one evening to witness the _tumasha_  (sport). As we approached the spot where the greatest concourse was  assembled, my ears were saluted by alternate shouts of what I was  subsequently informed were intended for the words âHussain, Hosein,â but  uttered by the whole mass as sharply and compactly as a well-delivered  platoon fire, or the fitful escapes of steam from an engine.    The English soldier, with the natural proneness of honest John Bull to  effect a national assimilation whenever he can, calls these processions  âHobson, Jobson;â and it is but fair to allow, that âHussain, Hosein,â  when shouted forth in the manner described, sound exceedingly like  âHobson, Jobson.â    On reaching the dense crowd, in the centre of which the tazeah, like a  ship on a heaving sea, rocked to and fro, a wild scene of excitement met  our view. Here were numbers of Mahomedan troopers, in their undress,  many of them carrying tulwars[48] under their arms, with fakeers,  servants, and bazaar people, all lustily lamenting the fate of Hussain  and Hosein.    The tazeah had a splendidly gilded dome, and in the front of it was the  figure of a strange creature, with the body of a camel, and a long  tapering neck, terminating with a female face shaded by jet black  ringlets; round the neck of this creature, which I take it was intended  to represent Borak, on which Mahomed made his nocturnal journey to  heaven, were strings of gold coins.    All this magnificence was supplied at the expense, I was told, of a  devout old begum, the left-handed wife of an invalid general at Chunar,  with whom, as will appear, I became subsequently acquainted.    On the seventh night of the _Mohurrum_, it is usual to celebrate the  marriage of Hussainâs daughter (nothing being perfect in this world  without a little love) with her cousin, a gallant partisan of the house  of Ali; Dhull Dhull too, the faithful steed of Hussain, his housings  stuck full of arrows, forms a part of the pageant, and serves to create  a still more lively image of the touching event which it is intended to  commemorate.    The Mahomedans, when worked up to a high state of religious excitement  and frenzy, on these occasions, are dangerous subjects to deal with;  very little would then induce them to try the temper of their blades on  the carcases of any description of infidel, Hindoo or Christian.    The relator was once at Allahabad when the great Hindoo festival of the  _Hoolee_, a sort of Saturnalia, and the Mahomedan _Mohurrum_ unluckily  fell together; and was present with the judge, Mr. Chalmers, when a  deputation from each of the religions waited upon him in connection with  the subject of the apprehended bloodshed and disturbance, in case the  processions of the two should meet.    The requests and the reasonings of the parties were highly  characteristic of the genius of their respective religions. The Hindoos  urged, mildly, that as their ancestors had possessed the country from  time immemorial, and long before the Mahomedans came into it, they did  not see why they should postpone the celebration of their religious  rites, because the former chose to take offence at them; they disclaimed  the slightest wish to insult or offend the Faithful, but contended for  their right to parade the city in procession, with music, &c., as of  old.    The Mahomedan moollahs, on their part, urged that, as the Hindoos were  kaffers and idolaters, it must be (and they put the case very feelingly  to Mr. Chalmers) exceedingly galling to them if they were allowed to  parade their music and processions near their mosques and tazeahs:                     âBetwixt the wind and their nobility.â    The judge endeavoured to impress upon these last reasoners that the poor  Hindoos had virtually as good a right as they had to perform their  religious rites in their common city; and as for their being  unbelievers, they could with equal reason return the compliment.    All this, however, had no effect; they could neither perceive the reason  or justice of it, and declared their dogged determination to shut up  shop and suspend proceedings, unless the Hindoos were forced to postpone  theirs, or remove to a distance; to this the judge refused his assent,  declaring that both parties should have equal justice, and that he would  avail himself of both the civil and military power to keep the peace  between them.    Some time after the departure of these deputations, information was  brought that bodies of armed Mahomedans were coming into the town and  assembling at the barree, or residence of one of their principal men, a  great landholder, who was considered the head of the Sunnis there. The  judge immediately ordered his gig, begged me to step into it, and,  accompanied by a couple of orderly horsemen, we drove to his residence,  which was situated on the banks of the Jumna. It consisted of many  buildings irregularly disposed through one or more courts, in which were  also situated two or three small mosques.    On dismounting, and entering the first enclosure, we observed many  Musulmans, with heads inclined as if in profound thought, slowly moving  about, and habited in long black tunics, the mourning garb of the  Sunnis, with real or well-simulated looks of dejection. There we were  met by the Mahomedan chief, who appeared to deem himself insulted by the  suspicion which the unexpected visit implied.    âFollow me, Sahib,â said he, âand examine all the arms my place  contains; you will find they are few, and only loaded with powder, and  could not have been bought for the purpose you imagine.â    On saying this, or something to the same effect, he took us to where  several rows of matchlocks, rusty and dingy pieces of ordnance, were  piled. The judge said he had feared that it was their intention at night  to commence an onslaught on the Hindoos, and that he was determined to  preserve the peace. The chief disclaimed any such intention, but I well  recollect his concluding observation.    âOur religious observance,â said he, âis _gum_ (grief), theirs is  _shadee_ (uproar, literally âa weddingâ), and they ought not surely to  be allowed to pass within our hearing; pray consider this;â and so  forth.    The result of all this was, that half a battalion and a couple of  six-pounders were ordered down to the city in the evening, and occupied  the chowk, or marketplace, during the night. This grievously offended  both parties, and they kept quietly within their several bounds. But for  this interference, there can be little doubt that blood would have been  spilt.                                       CHAPTER XXIII.      The cornet took me with him to breakfast and dine with his friend, the  old invalid general commanding at Chunarghur. This was my first  Christmas Day in India; the weather was as cold as an English October,  and I enjoyed the trip.    The pretty invalid station of Chunarghur is a few miles from Sultanpore,  on the opposite bank of the river; as you approach it, the fort,  crowning a lofty table rock, and abutting on the Ganges, has, with its  numerous Moorish buildings and lines of circumvallation, a very striking  and picturesque effect; and its reddish hue and that of the rock  contrast pleasingly with the verdant gardens and white residences of the  European inhabitants.[49]    The general, a hoary old Indianized veteran, gave my friend, with whom  he appeared to be on intimate terms, a very hearty reception. It being  Christmas Day, he had mounted his red uniform coat, which, from the hue  of the lace, and other unmistakable signs, it was very clear, had been  laid up in ordinary for a considerable time; but though his upper works  were European, all below indicated one who had imbibed, in the course of  fifty or sixty yearsâ service, a taste for the luxurious appliances of  an Indian existence. His legs, like those of Colonel Lolsaug, were  encased in voluminous _pajammas_, which finished off with a pair of  Indian gilt slippers.    We had a capital breakfast, at which an abundance of solid cheer,  interspersed with glasses of amber jelly, and garnished with evergreens  and flowers, âjasmin and marigolds,â produced a truly Old English  effect.    The old general leaned back in his easy chair, stretched his legs on a  morah, smoked his magnificent hookha, and prepared to receive a host of  people waiting outside to pay their respects.    In India, Christmas Day is called by the natives our â_Burra Din_,â or  great day. Our native soldiers and dependants attend in their best  attire, to pay their respects, and present, according to their means,  little _nuzzurs_ or gifts, as tokens of good-will and fidelity. Your  Kansaman brings a basket of sweetmeats; the shepherd, a kid from the  flock; the gardener, a basket of his choicest fruit, flowers, and  vegetables; the bearers deck the bungalow with evergreens, or plant a  young tree in front of the door, and so forth.    It is a pleasing homage to master and his faith; and altogether, with  the temperature of the weather and the solidity of the fare, tends  strongly to awaken bygone recollections of youth, and all the charities  and endearments of our island home at that delightful and merry season.    The _chick_, or blind, being now rolled up, a _posse_ of venerable  veteran native officers entered, exhibiting on their persons the various  obsolete costumes of the Indian army of half a century back, gradually  approximating from the uncouth attire of the sepoy of the olden time,  with its short vandyked _jangheeas_, half-way down the thigh, cut-away  coat, and ludicrous triangular-fronted cap, to the more perfect  Europeanized dress at present worn.    Each bore on his extended palm a folded-up handkerchief, on which lay a  certain number of gold mohurs or rupees, which the old general, contrary  to the usual custom in such cases, groped off, and laid beside him in a  heap, having previously touched his forehead, by way of acknowledging  the compliment.    Besides the pecuniary offering, many of the veterans held their swords  to the general and my friend, who touched them, and then their  foreheads. This pretty custom is universal amongst the military of India  and Persia, and is finely expressive of a soldierâs fidelity and  devotion. He offers you his sword; what can he more?    After the military had entered, various civil functionaries, connected  with the bazaar and garrison, and the generalâs domestic servants, all  arrayed in their holiday attire, were ushered in, and made their salaams  and gifts. The latter were set aside in the room, and formed a goodly  display of oranges, pomegranates, sweetmeats, sugar-candy, &c., enough  wherewith to set up the store of a general dealer in a small way.    Last of all, several trays were brought in, each covered with an  embroidered roomal or handkerchief; the bearers, having arranged these  on the floor, withdrew the coverings with a grand air, as much as to  say, âThere! what do you think of that?â and a magnificent display of  good things appeared. The Kansaman whispered the old general; the old  general smiled, and my friend laughed. It was a Christmas gift from  Begum Sahib, his pious left-handed Moosulmanee wife, and whose funds had  supplied, as I before mentioned, the magnificent _tazeea_ at Sultanpore,  Benares.    Whilst its examination was going on, I thought I perceived a few curious  eyes peeping from behind the curtain, which concealed the _sanctum  sanctorum_ of the _zenan khaneh_, or female apartments.    After the whole party had retired, and the general and my friend had  resumed their chat and their hookhas, I observed the aforesaid curtain  once more on the move, and, immediately after, the figure of an old  withered Indian lady, covered with a profusion of rings and jewels, with  a pair of garnet-coloured trousers of formidable dimensions, and a  milk-white _doputta_, or scarf, over her head, issued therefrom.    She stood for a moment, placed her finger archly on her lips, as a  signal for my friend to be silent, and then gliding slowly towards the  veteran, whose back was turned towards her, she placed her long dark  slender hands, sparkling with rings, over his eyes.    âHalloa!â said the old gentleman, âwho have we here? what rogue is  this?â smiling pleasantly, and knowing all the while who it was.    The old lady laughed, withdrew her hands, and stood before him.    âGeneral Sahib,â said she, in Hindustanee, âI am come to make my salaam  to you on your _Burra Din_.â    She now took a chair; my friend the cornet, who evidently knew her well,  made her a respectful salaam, and they held a very animated conversation  together, of which, from their eyes being directed towards me ever and  anon, I guessed myself to be the subject. I was a modest youth in those  days, and felt a little embarrassed at the idea of being overhauled and  discussed in an âunknown tongue.â    The cornet said: âThe Begum has been asking about you; she says you look  very young; quite a _chokra_ (boy), and have a very _gureeb_ (quiet)  look, though, she dares to say, you are a bit of a _nut cut_ (roguish  fellow) for all that.â    âPray tell her,â said I, âthat she does me too much honour, and that I  really want language to express the extent of my obligation. As for the  first fault, time doubtless will correct it; with respect to the other,  you may say it is an hereditary complaint in our family.â    The cornet explained, or tried to explain; the old lady laughed, nodded  her head, and said it was â_burra taiz bhat_â (a very smart reply). She  now retired to her apartment, after a fresh round of salaaming between  her and the cornet.    âI thought,â said I, when she had gone, âthat it was not usual for  native ladies to exhibit themselves in that way.â    âNor is it,â said he, âgenerally; but age and other circumstances lead  to exceptions in this as well as in everything else. Besides,â added he,  âthough the old lady is both rich and devout, she does not, of course,  hold a foremost place in native estimation.â    The general, who had left us for a few moments, now returned, and after  some little conversation, of which she was the subject, being spoken of  in a laudatory strain, âWell, now,â said he, as if he had been revolving  the matter deeply, âI donât know, but I consider that old woman as much  my wife as if we had had a page of Hamilton Moore read over to us. My  faithful companion for forty years, and the mother of my children!â    âBut,â said the cornet, âyour friend the Padre, you recollect, when he  was passing, took dire offence at her making her appearance one day when  he was here; do you recollect that, general? You had quite a scene.â    The general here emitted a panegyrical effusion touching the whole  clerical body, and the scrupulous Padre in particular, which, however, I  will not repeat.    After tiffin, the general, the cornet, and myself, went out to visit the  fort and the neighbourhood, which I had a desire to see; the former,  being old and infirm, rode in his _tonjon_ (a sort of chair-palankeen);  my friend and I were on horseback.    The fort of Chunarghur, to which we ascended from the town side by a  somewhat steep road, occupies the summit of a table rock, some hundred  feet above the surrounding country, and terminating abruptly on the  river side. A strong wall, defended by numerous towers, runs round the  edge, and the interior contains modern ranges of barracks, magazines,  &c., and some fine masses of old buildings, in the Moorish style of  architecture, characterized by the cupolas, horseshoe arch, &c.    The views on all sides are extensive and interesting: on the one, you  look down upon the roofs of the closely-built native town, its temples  and intermingled foliage, and tall bamboo pigeon-stands, with the white  houses and luxuriant gardens of the adjacent station, the broad Ganges  skirting the verdant slopes in front, and stretching away through many a  sandy reach towards Benares; on the opposite side, above the fort, a  rich and cultivated country, waving with crops, adorned with mango  groves, and dotted here and there with old mosques or tombs, extends far  in the distance, traversed by bold sweeps of the river, which, sprinkled  with many a white sail, or strings of heavy boats, advancing with  snail-like pace against the current, glistens brightly below.    The general pointed out to me the particular part of the wall where we  made our unsuccessful assault in the year 1764, with some other lions of  the place; after which we left the fort by another gateway, and a  somewhat zigzag descent, on the opposite side to that on which we had  entered.    In passing a guard of invalids, however, before emerging, I was highly  entertained to see the old veterans, who were rather taken by surprise,  hobbling out from their pipes and repose in a mighty pother, to present  arms to the general, which they managed to effect before he had left  them far behind, with a most picturesque irregularity.    Chunar, some thirty or forty years before the period to which I am  adverting, had been, I believe, one of our principal frontier stations,  and the head-quarters of a division, though then, as now, scarcely  occupying a central point in the immense line of the British dominions  on this side of India. The cantonments of this large force were situated  on the plain last noticed, above the fort, and present small station,  though almost every trace of it has long disappeared, at least of the  abodes of the living, for the mansions of the dead still remain nearly  _in statu quo_ to tell their pensive tale.    We paid a visit to this now remote and forgotten burying ground (or  rather to one of them, for there are two) a mile or two beyond the fort;  and I confess, albeit a juvenile, that I was touched at the sight of  these lonely mementoes of the fact, that a bustling military cantonment,  of which hardly a vestige remains, once occupied the immediate vicinity.    How changed is now the scene from what it was in the _qui hye_ days of  our fathers! The clang of the trumpet, the roll of the drum, and the  gleaming ranks, have long given place to more peaceful sounds and  sights; the creak of the well-wheel, and the song of the ryot, as he  irrigates his fields, supply the place of the former. Grain now waves  where troops once manÅuvred, whilst the light airs of the Ganges pipe,  amidst the white mausoleums, the dirges of those who âsleep wellâ  beneath, many of the once gay inhabitants of the scene:â              âAh! sweetly they slumber, nor hope, love, nor fear;            Peace, peace is the watchwordâthe only one here.â    There are few things which address themselves more strongly to the  feelings than the sight of the tombs of our countrymen in a far distant  land. In the cemetery to which I am referring, now rarely visited, it  being out of the track of travellers, where grass and jungle are fast  encroaching, and time and the elements are pursuing their silent  dilapidations, many a Britonâmany a long forgotten Johnson and  Thompsonâquietly repose, far from the hearths of their fathers.    I have since more than once visited this and similar places, which may  be compared to wrecks which the onward flow of our advancing power  leaves behind it, and as I have stood and mused amongst them, have  pleased myself by indulging in dreamy speculations touching the  histories of the surrounding sleepers (for all have their little  histories), of all their hopes, fears, and cares, here for ever laid at  rest.    We extended our excursion to some distance beyond the cemetery, and  visited the mausoleum of a Mahomedan prince or saint, the history of  which I have forgotten. I have now only a faint remembrance of its  mosaic and lattice-workâits inlaid scrolls from the _Koran_âthe  sarcophagus covered with an embroidered carpet, the lamps around, and  the ostrich eggs suspended from the vaulted roof.    On returning home to the old generalâs house, rather late, we found two  or three of his friends, invalid officers of the garrison, assembled to  do justice to his roast beef and other Christmas fare. A very social  party we had; the general âshouldered his crutch,â and the invalid  guests gave us plenty of Indian legendary lore; all hearts expanded  under the influence of good cheer, and a couple of bottles of âSimkin  Shrobâ (Champagne), which the general produced as if it had been so much  liquid gold, reserved for high days and holidays.    A glass or two of champagne is your grand specific for giving the blue  devils their _quietus_, and liberating those light and joyous spirits  which wave their sparkling wings over the early wine-cup and the genial  board; but, like other ephemerÃ¦, soon pass away, drowned, perhaps, like  flies, in the liquid from whence they spring, leaving but a pleasing  remembrance of their having once existed.    The next morning, after breakfast, the cornet and I rode back to  Sultanpore, and in a few days I bade him adieu, and in a short time  found myself sound in wind and limb, but quite out of _rootie mackun_  (âbread and butterâ), and other river stores, in sight of the far-famed  fortress of Allahabad, at the confluence of the Jumna and Ganges.    The view of this fortress, with its lofty walls and numerous towers, is,  as you approach it, very striking; one sees few such imposing masses in  England; and as for our feudal castles, few of them are much bigger than  the gateways of such places as I am describing.    The fort which occupies the point where these two famous rivers meet,  though perfectly Oriental in its general character, has been âpointed,â  and strengthened in accordance with the principles of European  fortification, particularly on the land side. It is impregnable to a  native force, and one of the principal depÃ´ts of the Upper Provinces.  This, as is well known, is one of the _Prayagas_, or places of Hindoo  pilgrimage.    During the great _Melah_, or fair, which subsequently it was often my  lot to witness, the concourse of people who assemble here from all parts  of the Hindoo world, from the Straits of Manaar to the mountains of  Thibet, is prodigious. The sands below the fort exhibit, on that  occasion, a sea of heads, intersected by lines of booths, and here and  there an elephant or a camel towering above the congregated mass.    The point where the all-important regenerating dip is effected, is  covered by the many-coloured standards of the Brahmins and Fakeers,  looking at a distance like a dahlia show, or a gaudy-coloured bed of  tulips.    In crossing over to the fort, in my bolio, I was forcibly struck by the  very different appearance in the water of the two streams. The one, the  Jumna, deep, blue, and pure; the other, the Ganges, yellow and turbid.  It was curious to observe them blending in many a whirlpool and eddyâthe  flaky wreaths of the dirty old âGunga-Jeeâ infusing themselves into the  transparent element of the sister river.    Here I laid in a store of eggs, bread, poultry, mutton, and the likeâof  the latter I purchased a magnificent hind-quarter from a bazaar kussai,  or butcher, who came staggering on board with it, patting and  attitudinizing it, and after pointing out its incomparable beauties, its  masses of fat, and the fine colour of the lean, &c., let me have it for  four rupees, just three rupees eight annas more than it was worth.    A few days brought me to Currah Munickpoor, where I found a sub, on  solitary outpost duty, who looked upon my arrival as an agreeable break  to the monotony of his lifeâa perfect Godsendâand treated me with  uncommon hospitality. I found him a very pleasant fellow, and his manner  of lifeâsmoking, eating, shooting, &c.âso much to my taste, that it did  not require any very urgent solicitation on his part to induce me to  spend two or three days with him.    I dined with him at his bungalow, some short distance inland, on the  first day, when he showed me the objects worthy of notice in the  neighbourhood, and thinking this a good opportunity to dress my  hind-quarter of mutton, I invited him to partake of it next day, on  board my bolio.    My acquaintance was a âmighty hunter,â as most young Indian officers  are. He shot, fished, and kept a pack of mongrels, and a greyhound or  two, with which he hunted the hare, fox, and jackal; he was also a great  adept in the use of the pellet-bow, in the mode of discharging which he  obligingly gave me some lessons.    I am not aware whether this sort of bow is known in Europe or not. If it  were as generally made use of amongst boys in England as by young men in  India, we should certainly have a fearful number of blind and one-eyed  gentry amongst the population.    This bow is generally made of a split bamboo, which, being highly  elastic, renders it peculiarly adapted to the purpose; it has two  strings of catgut, which, at about a foot from one extremity, are kept  separate by a small piece of stick, about an inch and a half in length,  the ends ingeniously secured between the strands of the string;  immediately opposite to that part of the bow grasped by the hand, and  which is well padded, there is a small piece of leather, about two  square inches in size, sewn to the two strings, and presenting its flat  surface to the handle; in this a pellet of hard, dried clay is placed,  and being seized by the thumb and forefinger of the right hand, is then  discharged at the object.    The great danger of the tyro is that of striking the thumb of the left  hand, within an inch or two of which the ball must always pass, though  by the practised bowman a collision is always avoided by giving the  wrist a peculiar turn or twist. The force with which the ball goes, when  thus propelled, is surprising; and uncommon accuracy in striking an  object may be in time acquired by a due regulation of the hands and eye.  I have brought down with the pellet-bow pigeons and kites, when on the  wing, from a great height, and cut off the heads of doves and sparrows  sometimes as completely as if it had been done with a knife.    As my friend and I strolled in the tamarind grove, near to which my boat  was moored, he exhibited his skill upon the squirrels and paroquets,  much to my astonishment.    âWill you let me have a shot?â said I, eagerly.    âCertainly; but have you ever attempted it before?â    âNever,â I replied; âbut there appears to be no difficulty in it  whatever.â    ââTis far more difficult than you imagine,â he replied; âit was months  before I got into the way of it; here,â he continued, âif you are  determined, you must. Now, twist your wrist thus, or you will infallibly  hit your thumb: there, so!â    âOh! I see,â said I; and immediately seized the bow.    A dove sat invitingly on a neighbouring bough; I gave a long pull and a  strong pull, and, och! hit my thumb a whack that bared it to the bone.  Away I tossed the pellet-bow to the distance of about twenty yards,  thrust the mutilated member into my mouth, and immediately fell to  dancing something very like Jim Crow. In a little time the agony  subsided; I had swathed the ex-member in fine linen, when Fyz Buccas  came to summon us to dinner.    âCome along, sir,â said I; âI hope you can dine off a hind-quarter of  mutton and a Bombay pudding.â    âNothing can be better,â said he; âbut where did you get your meat?â    âI bought it of a bazaar fellow at Allahabad, and a splendid joint it  is.â    My companion, more experienced in the tricks of India than myself,  smiled incredulously, and then looked a little grave.    âI hope they have not given you a made-up article.â    âMade-up!â said I; âI donât understand you.â    âWhy,â he replied, âthese bazaar rascals stuff and blow up their meat,  and use half a dozen other different ways of taking in the unwary  passenger.â    ââPon my life,â said I, âyou frighten me; if this my best bower fails,  we shall go plump on the rocks of short commons, thatâs certain.â    âOh, never mind,â said he; âat the worst, my place is not far off, and  there is abundance of prog there; besides, I can eat bazaar mutton, or  goat, or anything else at a pinch, particularly if there is a good glass  of Hodgson to wash it down.â    This dialogue was cut short by the entry of the mutton; it certainly did  not look as respectable mutton should look. I seized the carver, eager  to know the worst, and gave a cut; the murder was out, and so was the  wind; the unhappy mutton falling into a state of collapse.    âHa! ha! ha!â roared the sub: âI thought as much; now try that mass of  fat containing the kidney, and you will have farther evidence of the  skill with which an Indian butcher can manufacture a fat joint of  mutton.â    I made a transverse incision into the membraneous sac, and there lay a  beautiful and compact stratification of suet, skin, and other extraneous  matters, which I extracted _seriatim_ at the point of my fork. I confess  I was thunderstruck at this profligacy of the heathen, which is,  however, common enough.    Currah is an interesting spot, abounding in picturesque ruins; and good  sporting is to be had there, the neighbourhood abounding in hares, wild  pea-fowl, grey partridges, and quail; the best cover in which to find  the latter is, my friend told me, the soft feathery undergrowth of grass  to be found in the indigo fields. In some of the islands of the Ganges,  black partridge, florikin, and hog-deer are to be met with, and there  are also plenty of wolves and hyÃ¦nas amongst the ruins, for those who  are fond of such sport.    The town of Currah, about fifty miles above Allahabad, is situated on  the Ganges, close to its banks, and presents to the view a confused mass  of mud buildings, buried in the foliage of numerous neem, peepul, and  tamarind trees; interspersed with these are several temples, musjids, or  mosques, as also some houses of stone or brick, displaying a  considerable appearance of comfort and convenience for this part of  India.    The vicinity is much cut up by deep ravines, formed by the annual rains  in their descent, through the loose soil, to the river. A little below  the town are the remains of a considerable fort, which from the Ganges  has rather a picturesque appearance; its gateway, and some lofty  circular bastions, are in a very tolerable state of preservation.    Lower down still, on the spot where I moored, are some pretty Hindoo  mundils or temples, from which ghauts or flights of steps lead to the  river; these are overhung by noble trees, principally the tamarind,  shedding a cool and refreshing shade over the spot.    Here I planted my chair on one or two evenings, with my friend the sub,  beneath the shade of these trees, and, soothed into a state of  tranquillity by the cooing of numerous doves, which fill the groves, I  gazed on the boats as they glided down the stream, and yielded up my  mind to the influence of tranquil and pleasing emotions. I thought of  homeâmy motherâthe widowâwhen I should be a captainâand other things  equally remote and agreeable.    The tamarind, to my taste, is the most beautiful tree of the Eastânot  even excepting the banyanâthe foliage, which is of a delicate green,  droops in rich and luxuriant masses, like clusters of ostrich  plumesâoverhanging a piece of water, or half-enveloping some old mosque,  durgah, or caravanseraiâwith the travellerâs horse picketed in its  shade, or the group of camels ruminating in repose beneath itânothing  can be more picturesque.    This tree, beneath which no plant will grow, seems to be a great  favourite with the natives, but particularly with the Mahomedans; it is  almost invariably to be found near their mosques and mausoleums; and  amongst them, I suspect, holds the place the yew, or rather the cypress,  does with usâan almost inseparable adjunct of the tomb:              âFond tree, still sad when othersâ griefs are fled.            The only constant mourner oâer the dead.â    A nest of Brahmins is comfortably established in and about the ghaut and  temple above mentioned, the duties of which latter they perform; these,  with bathing, eating, sleeping, and fleecing European passers-by,  constitute the daily tenor of their _harmless_ lives. They regularly  levy contributions from European travellers who pass this way, and make,  I suspect, rather a good thing of it.    Their course of proceeding is as follows: one of the fraternity, with  all the humility of aspect which characterized Sterneâs monk, waits upon  the traveller with a little present of milk, fruit, or a pot of tamarind  preserveâthe last, by the way, uncommonly good thereâthis, in a subdued  tone, and with a low salaam, he tenders for acceptance, and at the same  time produces for inspection a well-thumbed volumeâof which it might  truly be said, in the language of the Latin grammar, â_Qui color albus  erat, nunc est contrarius albo_ââpartly filled with names, doggrels, and  generally abortive attempts at the facetious. In this the traveller is  requested to record his name, the date of his visit, with the addition  of as much epigram as he can conveniently squeeze out, or of any  _extempore_ verses he may chance to have by him ready cut and dry for  such occasions.    Having made his literary contribution, and returned the valuable  miscellany to its owner, in whose favour the travellerâs romantic  feelings are perhaps warmly excited, particularly if, like me, a â_tazu  wulait_â (literally, a fresh-imported European), with some St.  Pierre-ish notions of the virtuous simplicity of Brahmins and Gentoos,  he begins to discover, from the lingering, fidgety, expectant manner of  his sacerdotal friend, that something remains to be doneâin fact, that a  more important contribution is requiredâand that the â_amor nummi_â is  quite as rife in a grove on the banks of the Ganges as anywhere else in  this lucre-loving world. On making this discovery, he disburses his  rupee in a fume, and all his romantic ideas of hospitable Brahmins,  primitive simplicity, children of nature, &c. &c., vanish into thin air.    My friend the sub lent me a pony, and, accompanied by dogs, servants,  and guns, we traversed a good deal of the surrounding country in search  of game and the picturesque.    The country, for miles around Currah, is thickly covered with the ruins  of Mahomedan tombs, some of great size, and combining, with much  diversity of form, considerable elegance and architectural beauty. Two  or three of these, more striking than the rest, are erected over the  remains of peers or saints; one of these latter is, I was told, Sheik  Kummul ud Deen, a very holy man, who, doubtless, in his day rendered  good service to the cause of Islam, by dint, probably, of that very  cutting and convincing argument the _shumshere_.[50] The adjacent  village of Kummulpore derives its name from him.    Kurruck Shah, I learnt from my young friend, who was a bit of an  antiquary, was the name of another peer of remarkable sanctity, who lies  buried near the town of Currah; his durgah or shrine, which we visited,  is situated in the midst of an extensive paved court, nearly encompassed  by shabby whitewashed buildings, shaded by two or three gigantic trees,  some of the arms of which were leaning for support on the buildings they  had so long shaded, like parents claiming in age the support of their  childrenâtheir natural props. It has, we were told, an establishment of  peerzadas, or attendant priests, and land attached for their support,  the supply of oil for the lamps, &c.    I could never learn clearly or positively the cause of so vast a  congregation of tombs as this neighbourhood exhibits, many square miles  being covered with them; but my companion was told by villagers whom he  questioned on the subject, that they covered the remains of the slain  who fell in a great battle. As, however, the dates on the tombs are of  various periods, this must have been the hardest fought battle on  recordâor the process of interment singularly slow.    Joking apart, to trust to the _on dits_ and traditions of untutored  peasants in any country is far more likely to lead to error than to  enlighten, in nine cases out of ten.    Having much enjoyed my three daysâ halt at Currah, I once more pursued  my onward course, my hospitable host sending down to my boat a profusion  of butter, fresh bread, and vegetables, for my voyage, with a piece of  mutton, on the integrity of which he told me I might confidently rely:  this was, at all events, _puffing_ it in a proper manner.    I found the country between Currah and Cawnpore to contain nothing  particularly remarkable; groves, ghauts, mud-built towns, ravines, and  sand-banks constituted its leading features. On one of the latter, one  fine cold evening, I performed the funeral obsequies of the one-eyed  bull-dog, who had been long in a declining state; the climate evidently  did not agree with his constitution, and he slowly sunk under its  effects. The interment was conducted by Nuncoo Matar, and Teazer, now  constituting the sum total of my kennel, stood by whilst his companion  Sully was receiving those last attentions at our hands.    At Cawnpore I put up with the major, who, the reader may remember, was  one of our passengers in the _Rottenbeam Castle_. He was a most worthy,  gentlemanly fellow, as great a griffin as myself, though likely to  continue so to the end of the chapter, for two very good reasons: one,  because he had passed that age after which, as I have before stated, in  an early part of these memoirs, the process of accommodation to Indian  habits becomes an exceedingly difficult one; and secondly, because he  had the honour to belong to one of H.M.âs regiments, in which it must be  sufficiently obvious, without my troubling the reader or myself with an  elaborate explanation, that a knowledge of Indian manners, language, and  customs is not so likely to be acquired as in a sepoy corps, where a  European is brought into constant contact with the natives.    The major, who was accustomed to the best society of England, had a  considerable admixture of the exquisite in his composition; but it sat  so easily upon him he did not know it, and being natural, was  consequently agreeable.    I would not have it inferred, exactly, that I think all things which are  genuine must necessarily please, but that nature is always a redeeming  feature, and when associated with what is in itself excellent, it  constitutes the master-charm.    The major gave me a room in his bungalow, to which I soon had all my  valuables transferred from the bolio. The same day the manjee came up to  make his salaam, and demand the balance of what was due to him for his  boat. He was accompanied by his sable crew, jolly fellows, who had  carried me on their shoulders over many a nullah, and plunged many a  time and oft in the Ganges for me, to pick up a bird.    There they were, âfour-and-twenty blackbirds all in a row,â in the  majorâs verandah, squatted on their hams, and dressed in their best  attire. Every face had become familiar to me; I knew most of their  names, their peculiar _fortes_, from the purloiner _en passant_ of  _kuddoos_[51] and cucumbers, the thief in ordinary to the mess, to the  instructor of the paroquets, and the cook to the crew, and associated  one or more of their names with almost every sporting adventure or  exploit in which I had been engaged on my way upâa long four monthsâ  trip.    It is true I subjected them occasionally to the rigorous discipline of  the Marpeetian code; in other words, thrashed them soundly when they  hesitated to plunge into an alligatorish-looking pool after a wounded  dabchick, or capsized my griffinship, as happened once or twice, when  staggering with me Scotch-cradle fashion, gun and all, through the  shallows, to my bolio; but the good-natured, placable creatures soon  forgot it, and we were on the whole very good friends. I believe they  knew I was a griffin, and, cognizant of the infirmities of that singular  animal, made allowances for me, particularly as I gave them sometimes,  by way of compensation, a rupee or a feed of _metais_ (sweetmeats).    Oh paying the manjee, he tied up the rupees carefully in the corner of  his turban, and made me a low salaam; his crew also bowed themselves to  the earth. So much for business. He then put up his hands, and with an  agreeable smile, and in an insinuating tone, said something which I  desired Ramdial to explain, though I partly guessed its purport.    âWhat does he _muncta_ (want), Ramdial?â    âHe _bola_ (says) if _Sahib Kooshee_ will please give him _buckshish_.â    âYes, yes; weâll give him some boxesâ_paunch rupee bus?_â (Rs. 5 enough,  eh?)    â_Han Sahib_ (yes, sir) _bus_ (enough).â    Having, in my usual piebald _lingua franca_, thus consulted my keeper of  the privy purse, I ordered him to disburse a gratuity of Rs. 5 amongst  the crew, which they gratefully received, with many salaams. Thus we  parted, never more to meet, and thus wound up my aquatic journey from  the presidency to Cawnpore.    The curtain is now about to rise on act the last of my griffinage, and  it may be some consolation to those who have sat thus long to witness  the performance, that they are approaching the _dÃ©nouement_, the grand  flourish of trumpets and _exeunt omnes_.    Cawnpore is the head-quarters of a division, and the station of several  thousand troops of all armsâwith some slight addition, indeed, of native  troops, a force can be despatched almost immediately from this station  with which hardly any Indian army of the present day could successfully  contend in the open field.    At the period embraced by these memoirs, a regiment of dragoons, two of  native cavalry, one of European, and three of native infantry, horse and  foot, artillery, pioneers, engineers, &c., &c., constituted the amount  of the military force at Cawnpore. The station itself has a bad name  amongst Indian stations, and richly does it deserve it. Dust, ravines,  and mangy black pigs are the most striking features of the cantonment;  and the neighbouring country is flat, arid, and peculiarly  uninteresting.    The society is large, and time is killed here pretty much in the same  way as in other large stationsâprivate and mess parties, masquerades and  fancy dress-balls, and private theatricals.    I passed a week with the hospitable major, which was principally devoted  to making the necessary preparations for my march. I had nearly emptied  the generalâs snuff-box; had no pay due; and was consequently obliged to  consider economy in my purchases, and to relinquish all ideas, if I ever  had them, of travelling _en seigneur_ or _Ã  la nawaub_.    The first thing was to purchase a nag, and the major in this undertook  to assist meâand thereby hangs a tale. He intimated to one of his  regimental functionaries that a young gentleman wanted a pony; and  straightway a rare assortment of Rosinantes in miniature made their  appearance in the compound. I never beheld the phrase of âraw head and  bloody bonesâ so completely reduced to matter-of-fact before as in some  of these _biting_ satires on the equine race, most of them  grass-cuttersâ tatoosâthe quintessence of vice and deformityâa breed  peculiar to India, and the very pariar of horses.[52]    âTry this fellow, Gernon,â said the major, laughing; âI think heâll do  for you.â    The major little thought how near he was to the mark. On his so saying,  I mounted, or rather threw my leg over a very angular backbone, and  seizing a primitive bridle of string or cord, solicited an onward  movement with a âgee-up.â    Now, whether it was that I touched a âtender point,â or being of greater  specific gravity than a bundle of grass, I know not; but certainly I was  no sooner in a âfix,â as the Yankees say, than the little devil emitted  an appalling scream, clapped back his ears, and commenced a rapid  retrograde movement, backing me into the midst of âseven devilsâ worse  than himself.    In a moment, I had double that number of heels in full play around me,  spite of the tatoo ownersâ attempts to drive off their animals. A  thundering broadside in the ribs of my Bucephalus, which damaged my leg  considerably, and other notes of battle sounding around, convinced me  speedily that the sooner my friend and I parted company the better. I  consequently rolled off, and scrambled out of the _mÃªlÃ©e_, receiving, in  retreating, an accelerator in the shape of another kick on or about the  region of the _os coccygis_. As for the major, he was almost in  convulsions.    âConfound it, major, thatâs too bad of you,â said I, âto get me on the  back of that imp, and now to laugh at my misfortunes.â    âOh! then, by dad, you must forgive me,â said he, his eyes still  streaming; âbut if it was my father himself I could not resist;â and  again he laughed till he gave up through exhaustion.    This over, I proceeded to a more cautious selection, and finally bought  a tolerably decent-looking animal for Rs. 25, and who, bating that his  fore-feet were in the first position, was worth the money. A small tent,  in India termed a routee, rather the worse for wear, I bought for Rs.  60, and this, with a Cawnpore-made saddle and bridle, a hackery, two  bullock-trunks, and a pair of bangy baskets, constituted my turn-out for  the march.    My friend the major kindly took me with him to messes and wherever he  was invited.    These mess parties I then thought very pleasant, though I confess I  should now derive very little pleasure from the scenes in which I was  then wont to delight, particularly on what were considered public  nightsâtoasting, speechifying, drinking, singing songs (many of the  grossest description), roaring and screeching, with the _finale_ of  devilled biscuits, daybreak, pale faces, perhaps a quarrel or two, and  half a dozen under the table, in a few words describe them.    Since those days, and twenty-five years are now equal to a century of  the olden time as respects progress, things have improved; we have begun  to learn in what true sociality really consistsâeven and tranquil  interchange of thought, with a sprinkling of decent mirth, the genuine  âfeast of reason and the flow of soulââto which eating and drinking, the  mere gastronomic pleasures of the table, are considered as secondary  rather than as principal sources of enjoyment.    The change, however, is yet but beginning; aldermen, it is true, have  ceased to be inseparably associated (as twin ideas) with huge paunches  and red nosesâyour seven-bottle men have enjoyed the last of their fame,  which reposes with the celebrity of a Beau Brummel; but too much of the  old Saxon leavenâthe wine and wassail-loving and gormandizing spirit,  with an excess of animalism in other respectsâstill characterizes us;  and, little as it may be thought, is a serious hindrance to social and  intellectual advancement.    The more exalted pleasures of the heart and intellect, let it be  observed in passing, can only be enjoyed, individually and nationally,  by those who can restrain their grosser appetites within moderate  bounds. This great truth the Easterns of old perceived, though (like all  truth when first discerned) it was pushed to a vicious extreme in this  caseâthat of excessive mortification.    This inordinate love of that which administers gratification to the  senses (allowable in a moderate degree) is, it appears to my humble  apprehension, our prime national defect; it engenders a fearful  selfishness and profusionâmilitates against that moderation and  simplicity of character from which great things springâmarks a state of  pseudo-civilization, and causes to be left fallow or but partially  cultivated the field of the benevolent affectionsâthe true source of the  purest enjoyments.    When man shall be sought and prized for his qualities and virtues, and  not for his mere adjuncts of wealth and station; when happy human hearts  and smiling human faces shall have more real charms for the great and  refined than the _pirouettes_ of a Taglioni or the strains of a Rubini;  when the glow of self-approval shall be able to battle with the  fashionable sneer and the âworldâs dread laugh,â and the duties of  kindred and country shall take precedence of âmissions to the blacks,â  and the like; then, indeed, shall we be opening a new field for the  mighty energies of our race, and entering on a happy millennium.    What a power to effect good, by leading the young and awakening spirit  of the age into paths of peace, do the aristocracy of this country  possess, if they would but use it! Standing on the vantage ground of  fashion, wealth and station, they might infuse fresh moral and  intellectual vigour into the nation, and stem, by all that is liberal,  ennobling, and refining, the somewhat sordid and mediocre influences of  mere commercial wealth. âTruth,â from them, would prevail with âdouble  sway;â whilst philanthropists in âseedy coatsâ may plead in vain with  the fervour of a Paul and the eloquence of a Demosthenes. âWhatâs in a  name?â says Shakespeareââa rose by any other name would smell as sweet.â  There the immortal bard utterly belied his usual accuracy.                                       CHAPTER XXIV.      A military execution must be, under all circumstances and to all  persons, an awful and striking exhibition; but seen for the first time,  it makes on the young mind a peculiarly deep and painful impression. An  European soldier of one of the regiments at the station had, in a fit of  passion and disappointment, attempted the life of his officer, and,  agreeably to the necessarily stern provisions of military law, was  sentenced to be shot. I witnessed the execution;[53] a solemn scene it  was, and one which will never be effaced from my memory.    The troops of various arms, European and native, were drawn up when I  reached the parade, and formed in three sides of an immense square,  facing inwards. The arms were âordered,â and a portentous silence  prevailed, broken only occasionally by the clank of a mounted officerâs  sword, and the tramp of his horses hoofs as he rode slowly down the  ranks. The morning mists were beginning to disperse, and the bright sun  was darting his long and almost level rays across the parade ground, and  gleaming brightly on a forest of steel and dazzling accoutrementsâthe  last sunrise the unhappy criminal was ever destined to behold.    The roll of the dram now announced his arrival, and soon the procession,  in which he occupied a conspicuous position, rounded the flank of one of  the sides of the square.    First marched, at a slow pace, a party bearing the coffin of the  condemned, followed by the execution-party; then the band, playing the  _Dead March_ in Saul: it was a frightful scene, and sent a damp to my  heartâwhat must have been its effects on the unhappy man himself?    Last in the melancholy procession came a litter (doolie), borne on the  shoulders of men; and in it, with a white cap on his head, and a face  calm and resigned, but deadly pale, sat the unfortunate soldier, for  whom, I confess, I felt most deeply. By his side, arrayed in full  canonicals, walked the chaplain, his book open in his hand, reading  those prayers and promisesâspeaking of pardon and hopeâwhich are  calculated to cheer the parting hour, and to soften the bitterness of  death.    The procession having passed slowly along the front of each regiment,  which, from the great extent of the square, occupied a considerable  time, now drew off to the centre of what, if complete, would have  constituted the fourth side of the parallelogram: there it halted.    The coffin-bearers placed their burden on the ground and retired; the  execution-party drew up at some distance from it. The prisoner left his  doolie, and, accompanied by the clergyman, walked slowly and with a firm  step towards the coffin; on this they both knelt, with their faces  towards the troops, and prayed with uplifted hands.    Profound was the silence. A soul was preparing for eternity! Being a  spectator at large, I selected my position, and being close to the spot,  saw all distinctly.    After some time had been occupied in prayer, the chaplain retired, when  the judge advocate, on horseback, came forward, and, drawing forth the  warrant for the prisonerâs execution, read it with a firm and audible  voice; at the conclusion, the chaplain once more advanced, and, kneeling  on the coffin, again, with uplifted hands, and deep and impressive  fervour, imparted the last spiritual consolations to the condemned.    What feelings must have torn the bosom of that unhappy being at that  moment! Set up as a spectacle before thousandsâan ignominious death  before himâand perhaps the thoughts of those he loved, of kindred and of  home, never more to be seen, adding another drop to his cup of  bitterness! But yet he quailed notâno muscle trembledâand a stern  determination to die like a man was stamped upon his care-worn and  marbly countenance.    The tragedy was now drawing to a close. The chaplain, with apparent  reluctance, rose and retired, and at the same moment the sergeant of the  execution-party advanced and bound a handkerchief over the prisonerâs  eyes, also pinioning his arms. Still not a muscle moved; there were no  signs of weakness, though the situation might well have excused them,  and the chest was thrown out and squared to receive the leaden  messengers of death.    The âmake ready!â and the crack of the muskets as they were brought to  the ârecover,â were startling notes of preparation, and fell with  sickening effect on my ear. I could scarcely believe it possible I was  looking on a scene of realityâa fellow-creature about to be shot down,  however deservedly, in cold blood, like a very dog.    âPresent!âââfire!â and all was over. A mass of halls, close together,  pierced his heartâover he went like a puppetâfell on his back, and never  moved a limb. Life seemed borne away on the balls that went through him,  and to have vanished with the speed of an electric spark.    There he lay, like fallen Hassan, âhis back to earth, his face to  heaven,â his mouth open, as if to put forth a cry which had died unborn  with the passing pang; one blood-red spot on his cheek, where a bullet  had entered, lending its frightful contrast to the marbly hue of his  features; the heel of one foot rested on the coffin, the other on the  ground; his hands open and on their backs.    A short pause now ensued, which was soon followed by a stir of mounted  officers galloping to and fro, and the loud command to âwheel back into  open column,â and âmarch!â    In this order the whole force advanced, the bands of the several  regiments playing in succession, as they marched past the corpse, the  deep and solemn strains of the _Adeste Fideles_, or Portuguese Hymn, a  dirge-like air, admirably adapted for such occasions, and which breathes  the very soul of melancholy.    As the flanks of each company passed, almost touching the dead man, it  was curious to observe the various expressions in the countenances of  the soldiers, European and sepoy, as they stole their almost scared and  sidelong glances at it.    The non-military reader will be a little surprised, as I am sure I was,  when I tell him that each regiment, after having passed the body a few  hundred yards, changed the slow to quick march, and diverged to their  several lines, playing âThe girl I left behind me,â or some similar  lively air, with a view, I presume, to dissipate the recent impression.    The wisdom of such a proceeding is by no means self-evident; it seems  indecent, to say the least of it: to be consistent, we should always  ring a merry peal after a funeral, or a gallopade home from church.    Bidding adieu to my friend the major, and duly equipped for the march, I  left Cawnpore for Futtyghur, and the following was the composition of my  rather patriarchal turn-outâhating the red coats and muskets of my  escort: a naick and six sepoys of Nizamut, or militia; we might have  passed pretty well for the section of a nomade tribe on the move in  search of clearer streams and greener pastures.    A two-bullock hackery or country cart, a very primitive lumbering  locomotive, whose wheels, utter strangers to grease, emitted the most  excruciating music, conveyed my tent, trunks, and hen-coops, with the  dobieâs lady and family perched a-top of all.    Then there was a bangy-burdah, with two green petaras, containing my  breakfast and dinner apparatus, whilst Ramdial, my sirdar, trudged on,  bearing the bundle containing my change of linen, and dragging my  milch-goat (for Nanny did not approve of marching) after him, _nolens  volens_.    Nunco led my dogs in a leash; to wit, Teazer, and a nondescript  substitute for the bull, with a few evanescent shades of the greyhound,  which I had purchased at Cawnpore. I named this animal, rather  ironically, âFly,â which Nunco manufactured into âPillai.â    Fyz Buccas, kidmutgar, trudged along, driving before him a knock-kneed  shambling tatoo, which I verily thought he would have made a spread  eagle of, laden with his wife, two children, and sundry bags, pots,  pans, &c. Whether Mrs. Fyz Buccas was a beauty or not I cannot  positively say, though, if I might judge from the sample of one  coal-black eye, of which, through the folds of her hood I occasionally  had a glimpse, I should decidedly say she was.    I generally rode ahead of the procession, armed _cap-Ã -pie_, and shone  the very _beau idÃ©al_ of griffinish chivalry. My syce always carried my  gun, to be ready for a shot at a passing wolf or jackal, and with one or  two other servants, viz., a classee, or tent-pitcher, bhistee, &c., with  my guard, we constituted a rather numerous party.    In the above order I left Cawnpore, for a small village on the road to  Furruckabad, where, in an extensive mango grove, I for the first time in  my life slept under canvas.    It is the almost invariable custom in India to march in the early part  of the morning, so as to reach the halting-ground before the sun has  attained much power; but I was either ignorant, of the practice, or  thought it would be preferable to reverse the system; certain it is,  that for some time I always marched in the evenings, arriving at my  ground sometimes after dark; by that means I was enabled to rise at my  own hour comfortably the next morning, and had the whole day till about  sunset for my amusement.    About that time I would seat myself on a chair under a tree, with my  kulian in my hand, and superintend the striking and loading my tent, &c.  About half an hour after they were fairly off, I would rise like a giant  refreshed, mount my steed, whilst my syce obsequiously held my stirrup,  and, fairly seated, would follow the baggage.    I love to recall in imagination those days, the opening ones of my  independent existence. How vividly can I recall the scene which this  march so often presented! the waning sunlight of the cold winter  evenings, a few bright streaks just tinging the horizon, my hackery  slowly wending its way over the plain, and my scattered servants  crawling behind it, in a cloud of dust; the mango grovesâvillagesâmud  huts, and all the accompaniments of a country life in Upper India!    I must not here omit to mention that, prior to my leaving Cawnpore, I  received a letter from my friend and patron Captain Marpeet, with whom I  occasionally corresponded; it was couched in his usual frank and  half-bantering style, and informed me that his regiment was on the eve  of marching to Delhi, and that he anticipated great pleasure in meeting  me there. Thus it concluded:â    âRecollect, my dear boy, I shall have a room at your service, and that  you put up with me on your arrival; you are not fit to take care of  yourself yet, and require a little more of my drilling and paternal  care. Give me a few lines from Futtyghur, and mention when I may expect  you. A friend of mine, Judge Sympkin, is now out in the district through  which you will pass, on some Mofussil business. I enclose you a few  lines of introduction, and have written to tell him he may expect you.  He is a princely fellow, a first-rate sportsman, and lives like a  fighting-cock, as a Bengal civilian should do. Hoping soon to shake you  by the hand,                                           âI am, worthy Griff,                                                     âYours, &c.,                                                             âJ. MARPEET.â    A few days brought me to Futtyghur, of which I have nothing particular  to record, excepting that the adjoining town of Furruckabad is  celebrated for the manufacture of tent cloth and camp equipage, and as  the scene of the defeat of Holkarâs cavalry by our dragoons in Lord  Lakeâs war.    By the way, an officer who was in that action told the relator, that the  Brummagem swords of the troopers would make little or no impression on  the quilted jackets and vests of the Mahrattas, and that he saw many of  them dismount and take the well-tempered blades of the natives they had  pistoled, and use them instead of their own. The keen razor-like swords  of the East give those who wield them a fearful advantage over men armed  with our mealy affairs. The former will split a man down from the ânave  to the chine,â or slice off his head with infinite ease (_sauf karna_,  âto shave him clean,â is the Indian phrase), whilst ours require immense  physical force to produce such a result.    The author once met some troopers of the 4th Regiment of Native Cavalry,  some squadrons of which were dismissed for turning tail when ordered to  charge the ex-rajah of Kotahâs body-guard, and asked them how they came  to disgrace themselves. The answer of one of them was,â    âWhy, what chance, sir, have we with men in chain armour, and wielding  swords of such a temper that they will cut down horse and man at a  single blow?â    I mention this as hearing on recent acts and discussions, not in  justification of the men, but as affording a probable clue to the  backwardness of our cavalry on some occasions. I think we are prone to  rely too much on the power of disciplined troops acting _en masse_, to  the neglect of those matters calculated to increase individual prowess.  Good arms are a first-rate consideration, not only for the superior  execution they do, but on account of the confidence with which they  inspire the soldier.    At Futtyghur my tent was besieged by the venders of cloth, &c., and one  man brought a number of tulwars (swords) made at Rampore, in Rohilcund,  a place celebrated for them, for sale. After some higgling, I purchased  one, a keen and well-poised blade, for the small sum of Rs. 4. I longed  to try it upon some neck or other, and, as luck would have it, soon had  the desired opportunity, on a felonious pariar dog, which had made free  with a portion of my dinner.    I had advanced some four or five marches beyond Furruckabad, each day  diversified by some novelty in the sceneryâsome fresh object, in the  shape of travellers, pilgrims, buildings, and the likeâbut still  beginning to feel the want of a companion whose language was the same as  my own, when one morning, as I was strolling, with my pellet-bow in my  hand (for I had resumed it, in spite of the crack on the thumb), I  observed at a distance a horseman slowly approaching.    As he came nearer, I observed he was mounted on a tall Rosinante-looking  steed, with a flowing tail and mane; his head-stall was of a sort of red  bell-rope-looking cord; a bunch of red cloth, something like a  handkerchief, dangled under his horseâs chin, from whence a standing  martingale passed between his legs. Amulets and chains were round his  animalâs neck, and the saddle (or cushion, rather) was covered with a  square broad cloth of red and yellow chequers.    The cavalier himself, a dark-bearded Mahomedan, was a fine specimen of  the Hindoostanee irregular horseman. His _chupkun_, or vest, of yellow  broad cloth, reached to his knee, and his legs were encased in long  wrinkled boots, something like Jack Sheppardâs, and which would not have  been the worse for a touch of Day and Martin.    On his head he wore a cylindrical Cossack-looking cap of black felt or  lambskin. A long matchlock was poised on his shoulder; a tulwar, or  scimitar, was stuck in his cummerbund or girdle, and a circular black  shield, of buffaloâs hide, swung on his shoulders.    Altogether, though I was brought up in the orthodox belief that one  Englishman is equal to three Frenchmen, and of course, to an indefinite  number of blacks, I cannot say I should have liked to encounter him upon  my tatoo. However, his was a mission of peace, as I soon discovered.    On seeing me, he dug his heels into his horseâs flanks, and was soon  beside me. Throwing himself off, he saluted me with an off-handed  _salaam_, in which _hauteur_ and civility were oddly blended, and then,  taking off his cap, he extracted therefrom a letter, somewhat  pinguinized and sudorificated, which he respectfully placed in my hands.  It was addressed to âEnsign Francis Gernon, on his march to Delhi,â and  ran thus:â      âMY DEAR SIR,      âOur mutual friend Marpeet has apprized me of your approach; I write,    therefore, to say that, as a friend of his, it will give me great    pleasure if you can spare me a day or two, if not pressed to join.    Your Colonel Bobbery I know well, and will undertake to mollify him if    necessary. The sowar, the bearer of this, will conduct you at once to    my encampment, and you can instruct your people to follow in the    morning. I have a spare tent and cot at your service.                   âHoping soon to see you,                                 âI am yours truly,                                         âAUGUSTUS SYMPKIN.â    âThat will do,â I inwardly ejaculated, as, after examining the seal and  superscription, I conveyed the letter to my pocket. I instantly ordered  my pony, and girding on my spit, wherewith to destroy any chance giants  or dragons I might encounter on the way, I gave the signal, and the  sowar and I were soon in a long canter for the judgeâs tents.    After a ride of about eight miles, the turn of the road exhibited to my  view the judgeâs encampment, in which were tents and people enough for  nearly a regiment of five hundred men.    Under a spreading banyan-tree were a couple of elephants, eating  branches of trees for their tea, as we do water-cresses, and sundry  camels bubbling[54] and roaring, and uprearing their lofty necks by the  well-side, where, from the force of association, I almost looked for  Jacob and the fair Rebecca, as represented in those Scripture prints  which in infancy we love to dwell upon, and whence probably originates  that exquisite charm, that, through our future life, is ever interwoven  with Eastern scenes and customs.    Under a couple of tamarind trees, four or five beautiful horses were  picketed; amongst them a milk-white Arab, with a flowing tail. This was  the judgeâs favourite steed. âPretty well all this,â thought I, âfor one  man, and he, too, perhaps, the son of some small gentleman.â    My arrival caused a considerable stir at the large tent. Two or three  chupprassies, or silver-badge men, darted in to announce me; the hearer  caught up the huge red umbrella or chattah, to be prepared for the great  manâs _exit_, and to guard his honoured cranium from the rays of the now  declining sun. One or two others held aside the purdahs, or chicks, and  Mr. Sympkin, a well-compacted, hearty, jolly, but withal gentlemanly  man, of forty-five or fifty, or thereabouts, stood forth to view; he was  followed by a fat squabby man, of the colour of yellow soap or saffron,  who, though attired in something like the European garb, did not,  nevertheless, in other respects, seem to belong to our quarter of the  globe.    The judge shook me heartily by the hand, and was at once so smiling and  cordial, that I began to fancy I must certainly have known him somewhere  before, and that this could never be the first of our acquaintance. It  was true downright goodness of heart, bursting through the cobwebs of  ceremony, and going slap-bang to its purpose.    âWell, Mr. Gernon, Iâm happy to see you here sound and safe. I hope my  sowar piloted you well; how far off have you left your tents?â    Having replied to these queries, he again resumed.    âWhen did you hear last from our friend Marpeet? not since I did, I dare  say. Come, give your pony to that man, and heâll take care of him for  you.â    I resigned my tatoo, who was led off.    The judgeâs servants smiled, and exchanged significant glances, as my  little jaded rat, with accoutrements calculated for a horse of sixteen  hands high, was marched away. I confess, for the first time, I felt  perfectly ashamed of him.    âCome in,â said the judge, âwe will dine somewhat earlier on your  account; but, in the meantime, as you must be fatigued, a glass of wine  will refresh you. _Qui hye? sherry-shrob lou._ By-the-bye,â said he,  recollecting himself, as we turned to enter the tent, âI had nearly  forgotten to introduce you to a fellow-traveller. Ensign Gernon, the  Rev. Mr. Arratoon Bagram Sarkies; Mr. Sarkies, Mr. Gernon.â    The little fat man smiled benignantly, as with a look betokening that my  youth and deportment had made a pleasing impression upon him, he, in a  manner half-Asiatic, tendered me his hand, as if he felt himself bound  in duty to back the judgeâs cordiality.    I was sorely puzzled to divine who this amiable little personage could  be, and to what portion of the church universal his reverence belonged.  Mr. Sympkin seemed, I thought, to enjoy my gaping looks of astonishment,  but took an opportunity of informing me, very shortly afterwards, that  Mr. Sarkies was an Armenian missionary, proceeding to Guzerat with a  camel load of tracts, in divers Eastern languages, for the purpose of  converting the natives.    At the same time that he gave me this information, he proposed, if  agreeable to me, that we should keep each other company for the few  marches during which our route would lie together. To this proposal I  joyfully assented, for though the good missionary was not exactly the  sort of companion I should have selected, had a choice been given me,  nevertheless, an associate of any kind who could speak my own language  was, under present circumstances, a great acquisition.    Dinner soon made its appearance in the tent, which was fitted up with  carpets, glass shades, attached by clasps to the poles, and, in short,  everything that could render it comfortable and luxurious, and make us  forget that we were in the wilds of Hindostan.    The viands, which in excellence could not be surpassed by anything  procurable, of their several kinds, at the most fashionable hotel or  club-house at the west end of the town, were served in burnished silver.  The wines and ales, of the most delicious kinds, were cooled _Ã   merveille_, and we were waited upon by fine, proud-looking domestics, in  rich liveries, who seemed fully sensible of the lustre they borrowed  from their masterâs importance; in short, I found myself all at once  revelling in luxury, and was made to feel, though in the pleasantest  possible way, the vastness of the gap which separates a griffin going to  join from the judge of a zillah court.    Mr. Sarkies, too, though his occupation referred more immediately to the  other world, seemed, like myself, by no means insensible to the comforts  of this mundane state of existence, paying very marked attention to the  mock-turtle, the roast saddle of mutton, maccaroni, and other âtiny  kickshawsâ that followed in abundance.    In spite, however, of this little trait of the âold man Adam,â the  missionary appeared a most kind-hearted and benevolent creature; there  was a childlike simplicity about him, evincing a total absence of all  guile, which at once inspired a feeling of affection and regard, adding  a proof, were it wanting, of the power of truthfulness and virtue, in  whatever form it may appear. It was obvious, at a glance, that the  Padreâs heart was overflowing with benevolence and love of his kind, and  that no one harsh or unamiable feeling harboured there.    The judge, though evidently of a jovial and bantering turn, and not at  all likely to turn missionary himself, seemed clearly to entertain a  mingled feeling of respect and esteem for his single-hearted, but  somewhat eccentric guest, who, I found, owed his introduction to him to  a somewhat similar chance to that to which I was indebted for mineâa  feeling that, in a great degree, restrained the inclination which, in a  good-natured way, would every now and then peep out, to crack a joke at  his expense.    After a very pleasant evening, I retired to a comfortable cot, which my  host ordered to be prepared for me; and next morning Mr. Sympkin, who  was engaged on some special business in the district, left us after  breakfast to attend to his duties and proceed to his cuchery tent,  around which were assembled horses and ponies gaily caparisoned, and a  concourse of native zumeendars, with their attendants, hosts of  villagers, witnesses, and the various native functionaries in the  judgeâs suite, who in India bear the collective appellation of the  âomlah.â    At tiffin he joined us, as full of spirits as a boy just let out of  school, rubbing his hands in a gleeful way, and asked me if I was  disposed for a dayâs shooting, for if so, he should be happy to show me  some excellent sport, the neighbourhood abounding in game. I need hardly  say that I was not backward in accepting his offer.    The day following was a most propitious one for sport, the air clear and  bracing, and the sun, as is the case in this latitude and season,  possessed of little power. Breakfast over, the judge ordered his gun to  be laid on the table, and at the same time asked me how I was provided  in that way. I told him I was possessed of a gun, but I dared say he  would not deem it a first-rate piece of ordnance.    âAllow me to look at it,â said he; âIâll send a man to your tent for  it;â and with this he despatched a servant to my routee.    The judge clicked my locks, turned the piece about, took a peep at the  muzzles, which were in rather fine order for cutting wadding, in the  absence of the instrument usually employed for that purpose, shook his  head, and returned it to me.    âCome,â said he, âI think we can set you up with a better piece than  that for the day; though,â added he, archly, âit appears to have seen a  little service too;â and so saying, he put together a splendid Joe  Manton, the locks of which spoke eloquently as he played them off, and  he placed it in my hands. âHave you ever shot off an elephant?â    âNever, sir,â said I, âthough I have ridden upon one more than once.â    âWell, then, you must make your first essay to-day; it is no easy  matter; you must allow for the rise and fall of the animal, and take  care you donât bag any of the black fellows alongside of you.â    I laughingly assured him I would endeavour to avoid that mistake.    âCome along, then,â said he; âI think we are now ready.â    The judge had two noble shekarrie, or hunting elephants, trained to face  the tiger, and for sport in general, which stood ready caparisoned, with  their flaming red _jhools_, or housings, in front of the tent. In the  howdah of one of them I took my seat, whilst the judge occupied that of  the other.    Duly seated, guns secured, brandy and lunch stowed away in the _khowas_  or dicky, the stately brutes rose at the command of the drivers from  their recumbent postures; the orderly Cossack-looking horsemen mounted;  the troop of beaters shouldered their long laties or poles, and we were  instantly bearing away in full swing for the sporting-ground. This lay  at the distance of three or four miles from our encampment, and  consisted of a long shallow jheel or lake, skirted by tracks of rank  grass, terminating in cultivation, villages, and groves of trees.    The elephant moves both legs at one side simultaneously, consequently  the body rises and falls, and his motion is that of a ship at sea, and I  felt before I tried it that I should make nothing of my first attempt to  shoot off one.    We now formed line, the judgeâs elephant at one extremity, or pretty  nearly so, and mine at the other, and advanced.    âKeep a good look-out, Gernon,â cried my host; âwe shall have something  up immediately.â    He had scarcely uttered the words, when up flustered a huge bird from  under the elephants feet, towering perpendicularly overhead; his  burnished throat, golden hues, and long sweeping tail, proclaimed him at  once a wild peacock. I endeavoured to cover him, but all in vain, my  gunâs muzzles, like the poetâs eye, were alternately directed âfrom  earth to heaven,â through the up-and-down motion of the elephant.  However, I blazed away both barrels, but without touching a feather. On  attaining a certain elevation, he struck off horizontally, wings  expanded, cleaving the air like a meteor; but, passing to the rear of my  companion, he, with the greatest _sang-froid_, rose, turned round in his  howdah, and dropped him as dead as a stone, amidst cries of _lugga  lugga_ (âhitâ)! _mara_ (âkilledâ)! and _wau, wau_ (âbravoâ)!    It is not considered very sportsmanlike to shoot the full-grown peacock  in India; the chicks are, however, capital eating, and are often bagged.  In this instance, the judge had evidently brought down the peacock for  my gratification; this I inferred from his immediately sending it to me  by one of his horsemen, who hoisted it up into the howdah at the end of  his spear.    As we advanced farther into the long grass, evidences of the deserved  character of the spot began to thicken around us; black partridges rose  every moment, and the judge tumbled them over right and left, but not a  feather could I touch.    Our line now made a sweep, with a view to emerging from the grass, and  immediately a beautiful sight presented itself; it was a whole herd of  antelopes, roused by our beaters from their repose, and which went off  before us, bounding with the grace of Taglioni. Two sharp cracks, and  _lugga, lugga!_ proclaimed that Mr. Sympkin had laid an embargo on one  or more of them. This proved to be the case, and a fine black buck  antelope, with spiral horns and a white streak down his side, and a fawn  about half-grown, were soon seen dangling from the broad quarters of the  elephant.    On approaching the very verge of the long grass, a cry of _sewer,  sewer!_ was followed by a wild hogâs bolting. I fired at him, and put a  few shots in the hindquarters of one of the judgeâs horses, who thereat  reared and plunged, jerked off his riderâs cap, and had nearly  dismounted the rider himself, whom I could hear muttering a few curses  at my awkwardness. The judge also discharged a brace of barrels at him,  but he got off, and we saw him for a great distance scouring across the  plain.    Having issued from the grass, the judge drove his elephant alongside of  mine.    âWell, how do you get on? I fear you found what I said correct, eh? You  havenât hit much?â    âMuch! I havenât hit anything, sir, except one of your sowarsâ horses, I  am sorry to say: it is most tantalizing! I doubt if ever I should  succeed in striking an object from an elephant.â    âOh, yes, you would,â said my host, smiling; âa little practice makes  perfect; but come, weâll try on foot, on your account, after we have  taken some refreshment; we will confine ourselves to the skirts of the  grass and bajrakates,[55] where we can see about us.â    Having refreshed ourselves with a glass of ale and some cold ham and  fowl, we proceeded to try our luck on foot, and I now had the  satisfaction of killing my fair share of game.    âYou have never, I presume, seen the mode in which the hog-deer is taken  in this part of the world?â    I answered in the negative.    âWell, then,â resumed Mr. Sympkin, âif disposed to vary your sport, we  have yet time before dinner. My people have the nets, and Iâll show you  how it is done; this will be something to put in the next letter you  write home to astonish them all.â    Having mounted horses, which were in attendance, we proceeded at a smart  amble to a pretty extensive tract of reeds lying at the distance of a  mile; into this tract, which terminated rather abruptly at some  distance, a line of men was placed, with here and there a horseman.    At the extremity of the tract of reeds, but in the open plain, two ranks  of men, with intervals of forty or fifty paces between each man, were  placed, in prolongation of the sides of the patch of reeds. These two  lines converged, and were terminated at the apex of the cone by a row of  nets, formed of stout tarred cords, slightly propped up by stakes.    The first-mentioned line now advanced with cries and shouts, and as it  approached the confines of the bank of reeds, two fine hog-deer broke  cover. The men composing the two lines above mentioned, whose termini  appuyed on the nets, now squatted down close to the earth, and as the  animals approached, they raised their heads successively; this alarming  them, and preventing every attempt to quit the street in which they were  confined.    In this clever way they forced the deer, edging them on at full speed  into the nets, into which they tumbled headlong, rolling over and over,  completely manacled in the toils. I never saw anything so cleverly  managed; the fellows did everything with wonderful coolness and tact,  and seemed perfectly masters of their craft.    Laden with game, after a most interesting dayâs sport, we returned to  Mr. Sympkinâs tent, where we found our smiling little friend, the Padre,  with his ever-ready hand extended, and prepared to receive and to  congratulate us.    After passing another day with our princely host, we took our leave and  commenced our journey. Our tents had been sent overnight, and after an  abundant breakfast, Ensign Gernon, the Griffin, and the Rev. Arratoon  Bagram Sarkies, soon found themselves jogging along, discussing things  in general in as cosy dialogues as those recorded to have taken place  between the renowned knight of La Mancha and his valorous squire. The  good missionary, I was flattered to observe, took a warm and  affectionate interest in me, which he manifested by a strong effort to  impress upon me the deep importance of his religious views.    One afternoon, as the missionary and I were sitting outside our tents,  my attention was attracted towards a group of sepahis engaged under a  banyan-tree playing the game of back-sword. As the mode in which this  exercise is conducted may be new to the reader, I shall describe it.    The first who entered the lists or circle of spectators were two  handsome and well-formed Rajpoots, who would have served for models of  Apollo, and who in this exercise display uncommon agility and suppleness  of limb; they were naked to the loins, round which, the hips, and upper  part of the thighs, was tightly wound the _dotee_, or waistcloth, which  sustains and strengthens the backâthe âgirding of the loins,â so often  mentioned in Scripture, &c. Each of the men held in his left hand a  diminutive leathern shield or target, less than a foot in diameter,  whilst his right grasped a long wooden sword, covered also with leather,  and padded and guarded about the handle.    Having exchanged salutes, one of them, holding his weapon at the  recover, and planting himself in a firm attitude, bent a stern gaze on  his adversary, which seemed to say, âNow do your worst.â    The other now commenced those ludicrously grotesque antics which,  amongst the Hindoostanee athletÃ¦, are always the prelude to a _set-to_.  He first, with the air of a _maÃ®tre de ballet_, took two or three  sweeping steps to the right, eyed his opponent for an instant, and then  kicking up his foot behind, so as almost to touch the small of his back,  he twirled round on his heel, and with his chest expanded and thrown  proudly out, made another grave and prancing movement in the other  direction; he now approached nearer, struck the ground with his sword,  dared his adversary to the onset, and again retreated with two or three  long back-steps to the utmost verge of the circle formed by the  spectators. Like cautious enemies, however, neither seemed to like to  commit himself until sure of a palpable hit.    At last, however, he who had been standing on the defensive, following  with his hawkâs eye the otherâs strutting gyrations, perceiving an  advantage, levelled a blow at his adversary with the rapidity of  lightning, which was caught on the target and returned as quick as  thought. A rapid and animated exchange of strokes now took place,  accompanied by the most agile bounds and movements; most of these blows  rattled on the targets; head and shoulders, nevertheless, came in for an  ample share of ugly hits.    The fight at length ceased, and the breathless and exhausted combatants  rested from their gladiatorial exhibition, amidst many â_wau, waus_â and  â_shabases_â (âbravosâ)! resigning their weapons to two others anxious  to display their prowess.    Subsequent experience of them has convinced me that a finer body of men  is hardly to be found than the sepoys of Hindostan, particularly in  their own country; for, taken out of it into a climate where the food,  water, &c., disagree with them, they lose much of their spirit and  stamina.    Our countryman, the British soldier, possesses an unrivalled energy and  bull-dog courage, which certainly, when the tug of warâthe hour of real  dangerâcomes, must, as it ever has done, bear everything before it; but  justice demands the admission that, in many other respects, the sepoy  contrasts most favourably with himâtemperate, respectful, patient,  subordinate, and faithfulâone of his highest principles being âfidelity  to his salt,â he adds to no ordinary degree of courage every other  requisite of a good soldier.    A judicious policy towards these men, based on a thorough knowledge of  their peculiar characteristics, may bind them to us for ages yet to  come, by the double link of affection and interest, and enable us, as an  Indian power, to laugh alike at foreign foes and domestic enemies;  whilst a contrary course, and leaving their feelings and customs to be  trifled with by inexperienced innovators, may, ere long, produce an  opposite effect, and cause them, if once alienated, to shake us off  âlike dew-drops from the lionâs mane.â    Serais, or places of entertainment for wayfarersâwell known to all  readers of Eastern tales as caravan-seraisâI frequently met with at  towns on my march, and sometimes encamped within or near the walls. The  serais, like the generality of buildings in India, are almost always in  a ruinous state, it being nobodyâs business to keep them in a state of  repair.    These structures, some of them the fruits of the piety and munificence  of former times, are a great public benefit; their construction is  generally similar, and consists of four walls of brick, stone, or mud,  sometimes battlemented, forming a parallelogram, having gateways at two  opposite sides, through which the high road usually passes. Small cells  or apartments, with arched entrances, run round the interior, in any one  of which the weary traveller may spread his mat, smoke his pipe, and  enjoy his repose as long as he pleases.    Each serai has its establishment of attendants, _bunyahs_ (shopkeepers),  _bhistees_ and _mehturs_ (water-carriers and sweepers), who ply their  several occupations, and administer to the travellerâs wants.    What a motley and picturesque assemblage do these serais sometimes  exhibit! In one part saunters a group of fair and athletic Afghans from  Cabul or Peshawur, proceeding with horses, greyhounds, dried fruits, and  the like, to sell in the south; their fearless bearing and deep voices  proclaim them natives of a more invigorating climate. In another, a  drove of bunjarra bullocks repose amongst piled sacks of grain, and  quietly munch the cud, whilst their nomade drivers smoke or snore  around.    Under the shade of yon drooping tamarind-tree, on a branch of which his  sword and shield are suspended, a Mahomedan traveller has spread his  carpet, and with his face towards Mecca (his _kibla_), his head hanging  on his breast, and his arms reverentially folded, he offers up his  eveningâs devotions; near him, on the little clay terrace, is to be seen  the high-caste bramin, his body marked with ochres and pigments, and,  surrounded by his religious apparatus of conch, flowers, and little  brazen gods, he blows his shell, tinkles his bell, and goes through all  his little mummeries, with the full conviction that he is fulfilling the  high behests of Heaven.    Groups of camels, tatoos, or the gaunt steed of some roaming  cavalierâsome Dugald Dalgetty of the East, seeking employment for his  jaws and sword, or rather for his sword and jaws, for such is the  orderâserve to fill up the little picture I have been describing, and  which in my griffinish days, and since, I have contemplated with  pleasure.    In a day or two we reached Allyghur, where my good friend the missionary  and I were destined to part, his route lying to the southward towards  Agra, mine in a more northerly direction to Delhi. Here I received a few  lines from Marpeet, saying that he was looking for my arrival with great  pleasure. âYou had better push on as fast as you can, my dear Gernon,  for your commandant, who is a crusty old fellow, and a very tight hand,  has been heard to express his surprise at your not having long since  made your appearance.â    This letter rather damped the buoyancy of my spirits. The following  morning I took leave of my good friend the missionary; his eyes filled  with tears as he clasped my hands in both of his, and whilst pressing  them to his bosom, pronounced a prayer and a blessing over me.    If it indeed be true, and we have no reason to doubt it, that the prayer  of the righteous man âavaileth much,â that prayer was deeply to be  valued. Short as was the time of our acquaintance, I felt as if I had  known him all my life, and was, consequently, much affected at parting.  Half-choking as he rode off, I waved him a sorrowful, and what has  proved a last, adieu.                                        CHAPTER XXV.      A few days more brought me to my last dayâs march on the banks of the  Jumna, and the mosques and minarets of the ancient capital of India  broke on my delighted view.    I had scarcely dismounted from my pony at my tent door, which commanded  a distant glimpse of the blue and âsoft stealingâ Jumna, when I  perceived three Europeans on horseback approaching at a hard gallop. As  they drew near, I recognized in one of the three my friend and Mentor,  Captain Marpeet. He was soon up, and warm and cordial was our greeting.    âWell, my boy, long looked-for comes at last; glad to have you amongst  us, Gernon,â said he, presenting me to his companions, two laughing,  beardless ensigns; âlet me introduce you to my two boys, Wildfire and  Skylark; two intractable dogs,â added he, laughing; âhave given me twice  the trouble to break in that you did.â    Wildfire and Skylark shook hands with me, and in ten minutes we were as  intimate as if we had known each other for six months.    âCome, mount again, Gernon,â said Marpeet; âyou are but a few miles from  Delhi, and it is useless for you to remain here all day. Come along; I  have breakfast all ready for you at my shop; your things, you know, can  follow to-morrow; you donât, though, appear to be overburthened with  baggage, Frank, eh? Dogs, tooâhahâregular terrier bunnow.[56] Great a  griff as ever, I seeâhah! hah!â    We pursued our course towards cantonments, Marpeet riding in the midst  of his _protÃ©gÃ©s_ as proudly as an old gander on a green at the head of  three orphan goslings.    We crossed the river Jumna in a broad, square, flat-bottomed ferry-boat;  and after riding through some rich cultivation on its banks, joined a  road skirting part of the ruins of ancient Delhi, which from that point  exhibited a confused assemblage of ruinsâfort, mosque, tomb, and  palaceâstretching far away behind us in the distance, towards what I  afterwards learned was the mausoleum of Humaioon.    I was particularly struck, as I rode on, by one large desolate building,  which Captain Marpeet informed me was the ancient palace of Firoze Shah.  A lofty pillar of stone, something like one of the round towers of  Ireland, rose out of the centre of it, whilst the whole mass of building  exhibited a touching picture of loneliness and desolation; long grass  and the silvery roots of the peepul grew around the battered arches and  casements, out of one of which a couple of fat and saucy jackals were  peeping, to reconnoitre us as we rode beneath.    We entered the modern city near the mansion of the Nawaub Ahmed Buksh  Khan,[57] through an embattled gateway occupied by a guard of Nujjeebs,  a sort of highly picturesque militia, attired in the Hindoostanee garb,  and armed and equipped with crooked-stocked matchlocks, mull-shaped  powder-horns, and other paraphernalia of a very primitive and  extraordinary description. These men, who were upon guard, were smoking,  sleeping, and doing their best to kill old Time, that enemy who, in the  long run, is pretty sure to kill us.    We were soon in that part of the town called Derriow Gunge, where a  portion of the troops were cantoned,[58] and drawing up before an odd  sort of building, of a very mixed style of architecture, my friend  dismounted, and announced my arrival at Marpeet Hall, âto which, my  boy,â said he, with a squeeze, âyou are heartily welcome, and where you  may stick up your spoon, with my two babes in the wood there, as long as  you please; donât blow me up, thatâs all, or set the house on fire, and  you may do what else you like. So now for breakfast,â said the captain,  cracking his half-hunter (whip), as a hint, I presumed, to the  _bawurchee_ (cook) to be expeditious, and shouting â_hazree looe  juldee_â (âbreakfast quicklyâ), he motioned us to enter, and followed.    The captainâs residence had been in the olden time a mosque or tomb, I  cannot exactly say which; but with the addition of a terrace and  verandah, and a few extra doors punched through walls six feet thick, it  made a capital abode, combining the coolness in summer and the warmth in  winter, which result from this solid mode of construction, with the  superadded European conveniences.    My friendâs house was but a type of that widespreading process of  adaptation which is now going on throughout the East, and its  inhabitants, and which, as long as it does not effect a too radical  alteration of that which ânature and their starsâ intended for a people  so circumstanced, is much to be rejoiced at.    Breakfast was laid out in a vaulted chamber, as massive as a bomb-proof,  the walls and roofs in compartments, with here and there a niche for a  cheragh, or lamp. There were we, a jovial quartetto, eating red herrings  and rashers of the âunclean beast,â where the moollah had pronounced his  â_Allah-il-Allah_,â or possibly over the respectable dust of some mighty  Mogul Omrah.    After breakfast, Marpeet took me to the adjutant of my new regimentâa  tall, strapping, good-looking man, of about eight-and-twenty, who told  me I must report myself immediately to Colonel Bobbery, the commandant  of my regiment, as also of the station.    âYou have been some time on your way up, havenât you?â said the  adjutant, significantly; âwe began to be half afraid that the Thugs had  made away with you, or that you had gone on a pilgrimage to Hurdwar.â    âI fear I have exceeded my proper time very considerably,â I replied;  âbut I must ascribe it to the hospitality of friends whom I met with on  the way.â    âWell, you must settle all that,â replied the adjutant, âwith the  colonel, who has often been inquiring for you, and to whose quarters we  will now, if you please, proceed.â    I began to feel confoundedly nervous, and to apprehend that I was now  about to taste a few of the incipient sweets of military subjection. The  adjutant buckled on his accoutrements, I did the like with mine, which,  at Marpeetâs suggestion, I had brought with me, and off we walked to the  colonelâs.    âRather a harsh man, the colonel, isnât he?â said I, as we went along,  hoping to elicit a little consolation in the shape of a negative.    âWhy,â said the adjutant, âhe is certainly a great stickler for duty,  and fond of working the young handsâwhat we call a âtight hand.ââ    I was âfloored.â    The colonelâs bungalow was on the ramparts of the city, overlooking the  Jumna, and the expanse of country through which it flows. Orderlies and  a posse of silver-stick men, &c., were about the door; we entered, and  the adjutant presented me to Colonel Bobbery, one of the most  extraordinary-looking little mortals I ever beheld.    The colonelâs height was about five feet fourâperhaps lessâand his body  as nearly approaching to an oblate spheriod as any body I ever beheld.  This orbicular mass was supported on two little legs, adorned with very  crumpled tights, and a pair of Hessian boots, then much worn, and  _minus_ the usual appendage of tassels. His neck, which was remarkably  long, was girt round with a very tight black stock, on the top of which,  as may be supposed, was his head, the most extraordinary part of this  very original specimen of âthe human form divine;â his front face  (profile he had none, which could be properly so called, bating an  irregular curve with a large bulbous projection about the middle) was  fat and rubicund; his nose Bardolphian, flanked by two goggle eyes, in  which the several expressions of intellect, fun, and sensuality were  singularly blended. A small Welsh wig completed the oddest _tout  ensemble_ I had yet seen in India.    âOh! you are the young gentleman we have been expecting for the last  five months?âbetter late than neverâglad to see you at last, sir.â    I mentioned something about friendsâhospitalityâand detention.    âOh, yes, yes! I know all about that; the old story; yes, yes! but you  must be quicker in your future movementsâeh, Marchwell?â said he,  turning to the adjutant; â_verbum sap._, you know, _verbum sap._â    After a rather prolonged conversation, during which I informed him I had  done duty with the Zuburdust Bullumteers, and gave him some account of  his friend, Mr. Sympkin, which he was pleased to receive, I rose to take  my leave.    âWho are you with?â asked the colonel.    I told him with Captain Marpeet.    âOh! my friend Marpeet, eh? Well, tell him to dine with me to-morrow,  and bring you with him. I dine at six, and wait for nobody. Marchwell,  Mr. Gernon will attend all drills, parades, and guard-mountings; we  mustnât let you forget what Colonel Lolsaug has taught you.â    I soon became comfortably domiciled with my friend Marpeet, who  introduced me to my brother-officers, and put me generally in the way of  doing all that was requisite in the new scene in which I found myself.    The more I saw of Marpeet, the more the extreme kindness and benevolence  of his disposition became apparent. The tenderness of his nature,  indeed, was frequently too much for his assumed rough and devil-me-care  manner (which he thought manly), and would sometimes, if he was taken by  surprise, show itself with almost a womanâs weakness.    Marpeet, as I have before stated, from invincible shyness, or  awkwardness with females, or dislike of the restraint it imposed, had  renounced the character of a âladiesâ man,â and was evidently doomed to  die an old bachelor. Still, we must all have something to love and be  kind to, be it wife, child, friend, cat, dog, or parrot.    Affection, if it has not something external on which to rest, turns to  gall, embittering the life which, under a happier state of things, it  would have sweetened. Marpeetâs benevolence displayed itself in his  kindness to youth: rearing griffins, till fully fledged, constituting  his extreme delight.    Never shall I forget the great satisfaction which his good-humoured  physiognomy would express when surrounded by a bevy of young hands, all  warm in their feelings towards him, and on perfect terms of familiarity,  but at the same time exhibiting that profound deference to his dictum on  deep and important points, such as the age of a horse, the manner of  performing a manÅuvre, or the way to make mulled port, and the like,  which had the most bland and soothing influence on his feelings.    Skylark, Wildfire, and myself, were his immediate body-guard; we chummed  with him, and though he allowed us to contribute to the house keeping  expenses, the lionâs share, if the phrase is here allowable, fell to  him.    He and I never quarrelled; but I could generally infer the state of his  feelings from the name or appellation by which he addressed me. âGernonâ  and âFrankibusâ were the zero and summer-heat of the scale, between  which were âmy lad,â âyoung gentleman,â âyou confounded griff,â  âyoungster,â and so forth; all of which, by the invariableness of the  circumstances which elicited them, indicated the state of his mind at  the moment: as âCome, my lad, this noise wonât do;â and âYoung  gentleman, I have to make out my report, and beg you wonât interrupt  me.â âWell, old boy, how do you get on? are you disposed for a game at  picquet?â and so forth; but, âCome, Gernon, I donât like that,â told me  his back was âhogged.â    One blot and inconsistency there was in Marpeetâs character: he was  addicted to flogging his servants for what we here should deem trifling  offences. On these occasions he always, however, put the offender  through the form of a trial, in which, to save trouble, he acted in the  quintuple capacity of plaintiff, judge, jury, witness, and counsel for  the prosecution. After a dispassionate summing up, the guilty party was  wont to be handed over to the kulassee, or tent-pitcher, to have  administered a dozen or two of strokes with the rattan.    Marpeet would justify all this severity very logically, but I shall not  trouble the reader with his reasons; certain it is, for all this, he  paid his servants regularly, was in other respects kind, and on the  whole very popular with them.    Not far from the Chandney Choke, the principal thoroughfare in Delhi,  near which I was now located, is the Duriba, or Lombard Street, where  the principal shroffs or bankers reside; here also many venders of  sweetmeats have their shops; one of these, in my day, was a jolly  fellow, who, out of compliment to his great Western prototype, was  called Mr. Birch, to which name he always answered when summoned to  produce some of his choicest imitations of English âsugar-plumery.â    I think I now see the good-natured fellow, hurrying out through his  ranges of baskets with a few samples for inspection. Many a time and oft  have Marpeet, I, and two or three jolly subs, after dinner, and under  the agreeable stimulus of an extra dose of the rosy beverage, visited  Mr. Birch, in the Duriba, all clinging to the pad of an elephant, whilst  the lights blazed in the bazaars around, fakeers shouted, women  chattered, and crowds of the faithful, moving hither and thither, gave a  most Arabian-Nightish character to the scene.    These scenes of the past come over me sometimes, when my heart is  sorrowfully disposed, with a sadly-painful distinctness; the laughing  faces of those who participated in them are vividly before me, but they,  âmy co-mates and brothers in exile,â where are they? Alas! with a sigh I  must answer the questionâgone! gone! Others occupy their places; they  will soon disappear to make way for more; âand thus wags the world.â    Oh, life, life! sad are thy retrospects to the best of us, and great are  the trials thou hast for even him whose lot is cast in the pleasantest  places; in thy sweetest pleasures lurk the germs of thy greatest  sufferings, and the more we cultivate and refine our natures, the more  acutely do we feel thy sorrows!    Happy ignorance! fortunate credulity! blessed insensibility! ye all  seem to have your soothing opiates; whilst he who girds up his loins  to seek the talisman of truth from amidst its innumerable  counterfeitsâcompensation for the past and something like certainty  for the futureâfinds the farther he moves the less he knows, and,  amazed and confounded at the profound and mighty mystery which  surrounds him, at length sits down and weeps. Well may we exclaim,                  âThe ways of Heaven are dark and intricate,                Puzzled in mazes and perplexâd in error,                The understanding traces them in vain.â    Virtue, immortal plant, ye will blossom, âtis true, in heaven, but must  ye here be ever rooted in sorrow and watered with tears? Oh! for some  mighty intellect, some second Newton, to call order out of chaos, light  out of darkness; to hush the Babel of discordant tongues, and give to  religious and moral truth that clear, convincing, and commanding aspect  which shall for ever abash the various forms of perplexity and error.  The awakening mind of the world demands something like unity and  certainty, and will have them if they are to be had. But to proceed.    One of the finest buildings in Delhi is the Jumma Musjid, the principal  mosque of the place. It has three nobly-proportioned domes; also two  lofty and magnificent minarets, which I have often ascended, and enjoyed  from their summits a noble prospect of the city and surrounding country.    From this height you look down on the flat roofs of the houses, and on a  fine evening may observe the inhabitants seated on them, and enjoying  their favourite, though somewhat childish amusements, of flying paper  kites and pigeons.    The pigeons, of which the Hindoostanees are great fanciers, and possess  a vast variety, are trained to join other flocks in their aerial  excursions, and then, by separating from them with great velocity, to  carry off some of those with which they were commingled; these they  bring back in triumph to their bamboo stands, at the call or whistle of  their owners.    At one extremity of the city lies the British residency, always the  scene of hospitable doings, but particularly so during the period to  which I am referring. The Resident at that time was a gentleman who,  with first-rate talents and solid virtues, combined those social  qualities which at once command what it is often difficult to uniteâthe  love and respect of all.    Nothing could be more agreeable than the residency parties, and on what  were called âpublic days,â invitations were extended to every one in the  shape of an European; old Mahratta officers, Portuguese, French, and  half-caste merchants, and others without the pale of the regular  service, and not constituting an ordinary portion of the society, would  swell the _levÃ©e_ on such occasions.    Punning, as a practice or habit, is the greatest of bores, and deserves  almost all that Johnson and others have said against it; I say âalmost,â  for I do not go the full length of that alliterative curmudgeon, when he  says, âHe who would make a pun would pick a pocket.â Had this been true,  many an accomplished Barrington would the residency of Delhi have turned  out at this period, with their distinguished chief at their head.    How this itch for punning got into the residency I donât know, but  certain it is it did get there, and proved remarkably infectious. A good  pun was a first-rate recommendation, indeed, at the residency table, to  him who made it. â_Aquila non captat muscas_;â which means, âGreat wits  donât condescend to make puns.â Granted, as a rule; but every rule has  its exception, and the Resident of that day was himself, âan the truth  be spoken, but little better than one of the wicked,â delighting to take  the lead occasionally in this conversation-burking system, where a man  lies in wait for his neighbourâs words, pounces on one that suits his  purpose, murders, mangles, and distorts it without remorse.    Occasional puns, if really good, give a poignancy to conversationâa  tonquin-beanish sort of odour, which in moderation is very agreeable,  but the excess of them is odious. I remember a few of the residency puns  which I think may rank with some of the fairest on record.    The Resident himself was once asked where he acquired his taste for  punning; he replied, that âhe thought he must have picked it up when  travelling through the _Pun_jaub,â through which country he had  accompanied a mission. A fisherman, to whom he had paid handsome wages  to supply him with fish, absconded. âI always considered him a very  _selfish_ man,â said the Resident.    One of the gates of the palace is called the âDelhi Gate,â and in my  time a subalternâs guard was always stationed there. A young sub, on one  occasion, at the residency table, I believe, asked a friend to take his  turn of duty there. âExcuse me,â said his friend, âI canât be your  _delegate_ (Delhi Gate) to-day.â    One observed that grain in one part of the city sold for so much. âYes,â  replied another, âbut that is not the _aggregate_ (Agra Gate) price.â    These samples may suffice.    I soon began to discover the truth of the adjutantâs remark, that  Colonel Bobbery was fond of âworking the young hands;â for, what with  morning and evening drills, parades, and attending guard-mountings, &c.,  I had little rest or enjoyment. The plain fact was, that I was bent on  pleasure and hated duty, and the colonel, by giving me âexcess onât,â  _i.e._ of the latter, seemed injudiciously determined to increase my  dislike.    The more I think on my early Indian career, and that of other youths,  the more satisfied I am that the sudden transition from school to a  state of independence is most injurious to the individual and his future  happiness; detrimental to the interest of the state and that of the  people we govern; and, in short, that school-boys are not fit to be  masters of themselves or to command others.    Nationally, we possess vast science and almost illimitable powers of  destruction; and nationally, too, we are respected; but not so much so,  I think, individually.    I have met with a great amount of calm, quiet, unprejudiced good sense,  much reasonableness and rationality, amongst the natives of India of a  certain rank, and, when such are disposed to give you their confidence,  nothing is more frequently the subject of remark with them than the  amount of power we confide to inexperienced handsâto mere _chokras_  (âboysâ), as they term them, and at nothing do they express more  surprise.    The natives of India are deeply susceptible of kindness, and possessed,  on the whole, of fine and amiable temperaments. If Europeans on all  occasions would regard their feelings and prejudices, which they  certainly ought to do, considering how strong are their own, I verily  believe that they might bind them firmly to us, that is, as far as  aliens ever can be bound, and erect our power on the noblest of  foundationsâtheir hearts. Still they must never be allowed to think that  our kindness springs from fear or weakness.    I am aware that the conduct of the English towards the inhabitants of  India is much more conciliating than it was; still, John Bull is ever a  rough subject, and too prone to employ the _fortiter in re_, rather than  the _suaviter in modo_. His pride prevents him from being amiable and  conciliating, and however much he may be feared and respected, he has  not the good luck to be loved, from the Straits of Calais to the Great  Wall of China.    I doubt if, in the present day, such freaks would be tolerated in a  commandant as those in which our old buffer was continually wont to  indulge, in order to gratify his odd and despotic feelings. Besides  abusing the men in the most violent manner (he had a regular ascending  scaleâa sort of gamut of _Galle_, _i.e._ Hindoostanee Billingsgateâon  which few could go higher than himself) till they trembled with rage and  indignation, he would, when out of humour, carry them straight across  the country, formed, in line, in a steeple-chase sort of style, over  banks and ditches, through standing corn and ploughed fields, for three  or four miles, as the crow flies, in a broiling sun, and then, galloping  home, would leave the next in command, or adjutant, to bring them back,  covered with dust and drenched with perspiration.    Once or twice he marched the corps in close column into the river Jumna;  when they reached the banksâthere shelvingâthey commenced marking time,  which consists in moving the feet without advancing; but the old  colonel, to their astonishment, roared âForward!â and on we all went,  till near waist-deep, when the column fell into a state of disorder; the  adjutant, on one occasion, tumbled off his horse in the _mÃªlÃ©e_, and got  a thorough soaking. The commander thought, I suppose, that, as good  soldiers, we ought to be able to stand âwaterâ as well as âfire.â    After I had been about a month at the station, I was put in orders as  the subaltern for duty on the Delhi gate of the palace, a vast  structure, occupied by the king and his relations and dependants, which  duty continued for a week. Having marched my company down to the gate, I  found the sub I was to relieve, with his guard drawn up, all as stiff as  ramrods, to receive me. After exchanging salutes, and receiving his  instructions to take proper care of the âAsylum of the Universe,â[59]  &c., he gave the word âquick marchâ to his men, sent them off under the  subadar, or native captain, and then proceeded to introduce me to the  quarters in which I was to pass my period of guard.    In passing the first archway, I found myself in an enclosure, formed by  lofty walls, round the bottom of which ran a line of arcades or  cloisters; at the other end of this enclosure was another noble arch,  surmounted by a vast and lofty pile of buildings, with windows and  galleries; these were the quarters of Major M., who filled the post of  killadar, or commander of the fort and palace guards, a kind-hearted,  hospitable, and brawny Caledonian, who, amongst other harmless  eccentricities, entertained the most profound veneration for the  â_Rowyal Hoose oâ Teemoor_,â as he was wont to call it.    My own quarters, to which the sub introduced me, consisted of a small  turret, in an angle of the ramparts, covered with thatch, and having  something the appearance of a bee-hive; it contained a table and a few  chairs, considerably the worse for wear, and when my cot was placed in  it, there was little room left for myself. Here, then, for seven long  days, I read, shot paroquets with my pellet-bow on the ramparts, cursed  the heat and the flies, and conjugated the verb _sâennuyer_ to  perfection, through all its moods and tenses.    One interesting break occurred, and that was his Majesty Ackbar Shahâs  going out one day, in grand procession, to visit the tombs of his  ancestors at the Kootub Minar.    On this occasion my guard was drawn up within the enclosure, to salute  him as he passed, whilst another company of troops, and two  six-pounders, were stationed without the second archway, on the plain  between it and the city, for a similar purpose.    Little did I think, in my juvenile days, when I looked on the stern  visage of the Great Mogul on the card covers, that I should ever have  the honour of paying my respects to that fierce Saracen _in propriÃ¢  personÃ¢_; but so it was. I had heard much of Eastern magnificence, but  had never seen before, nor have I indeed since, anything that so  completely realized my vague ideas of barbaric pomp, as this procession  of the King of Delhi.    Though there was much in it that was imperfect, and which told of  reduced means and insufficient resources, it was still a most striking  pageant, and, as it issued tumultuously from those noble and resounding  gateways, amidst the clang of wild instruments and echoing voices, I  confess I was delighted and astonished, and was able to picture most  forcibly what these things must have been when the Moguls were in the  zenith of their power.    We had waited for some time, expecting his majesty to make his  appearance; when at length confused sounds and a distant hubbub  announced that he was on the move; presently, ever and anon, a cavalier,  some omrah of the old noblesse, or inferior horseman, would come  pricking forth from under the arch; then another and another; then  steeds curveting and caracoling, and covered with rich housings and  silver ornaments. After this came his majestyâs regiment of Nujjeebs,  hurrying forth, a wild-looking body of bearded Mahomedan soldiery, armed  with matchlocks and shields, and attired in dark _chupkuns_, or vests,  and red turbans; next came his camel corps, each man with a little  pattereroe, or swivel gun, on the bow of his camelâs saddle, ramming  down and blazing away at a furious rate.    By the way, I was told that, on one of these occasions, a fellow, in his  hurry, shot off his camelâs head.    After these followed a confused assemblage of chiefs on horseback, a  knightly train; their steeds, half-painted vermilion or saffron colour,  adorned with silver chains, and housings almost touching the ground,  some of them composed of the silvery chowries, or Tartarian cowsâ tails;  mingled with these were litters, with dome-like canopies and gilded  culesses, containing ladies of the harem, with numerous attendants.    The uproar now increased, and a numerous body of men followed on foot,  bearing crescents, green standards, golden fish on poles, and other  insignia of the royal dignity; all loudly shouting forth the now empty  titles of the fallen monarch. These, his immediate avant-couriers, were  followed by the king himself, seated on an enormous elephant, covered  with a superb _jhool_, or housings, of crimson velvet; the huge tusks of  the monster being adorned with silver rings, whilst his head was painted  with crimson and yellow ochres, in bars and flourishes, like the face of  a North American savage, when arrayed for battle.    The king, Ackbar Shah the Second, an aged and venerable man, adorned  with jewels and aigrettes in his turban, sat immovable in a silver  howdah, looking straight before him, neither to the right nor left, up  nor down (for it is considered beneath the dignity of the âSon of the  Sun and Moonâ to notice sublunary matters), whilst his youngest and  favourite son Mirza Selim, a youthful and handsome man, sat behind him,  slowly waving over his head a chowry, or fan, formed of the tail of the  peacock. His majestyâs elephant was followed by many others, more or  less superbly decorated, bearing his relations, and the various officers  and dependants of the court.    The assemblage of these vast animals, the litters, horsemen, and  multitudinous array, combined with the Moresque buildings around, so  admirably in keeping, altogether constituted to my mind a perfect scene  of romance, which it took me two sides of foolscap properly to describe  for the gratification of my friends at home.    I pictured to myself, I remember, as I wrote that account, the delight  it would cause when read by my mother to the fireside circle in the  little green parlour, whilst old Thomas, our lame footman, lingered,  with the kettle in his hand, to catch some of Master Frankâs account of  the âGreat Mowgul in the Heast Hingies.â    Well, time wore on; some months had elapsed, during which nothing very  particular had occurred, excepting that I received a letter from the  charming widow, announcing that my kind friend, the old general, had at  last gone to his long home.    It was an admirable epistle, written with all that proper feeling which  such an event would naturally call forth in the breast of an  accomplished woman and affectionate daughter. It breathed a spirit of  resignation, and contained many beautiful, though not very new,  reflections touching the frail tenure of existence, and of that  inevitable termination of it which is alike the lot of us all.    The general, she said, had not forgotten me in his parting moments, but  sent me his blessing, with a hope that I would not forget his advice,  and would strive to emulate my uncle, who seemed, indeed, to have been  his model of a cavalier.    In conclusion, she stated that she was about to join some relations who  were coming to the Upper Provinces, and hoped she might have an  opportunity shortly of renewing my acquaintance, and of assuring me in  person that she was âmine very truly.â    Yes, mine very truly! I saw I was hooked for the widow, and began to put  more faith than ever in the Chinese doctrine of invisible attraction.  âLet me see,â said I; âthe widow is two-and-twenty, I eighteen; when Iâm  two-and-twenty, she will be six-and-twenty. Oh, âtwill do admirably!  what matters a little disparity?â So I whistled _Lillabulero_, after the  manner of my uncle Toby, concluding _affettuoso_â                 And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart               Shall entwine itself verdantly still.    âCaptain Marpeet,â said I, one day, after breakfast, âI shall to-morrow  have been just one year in the country, and according to the _Lex  Griffiniensis_ I shall be no longer a greenhorn.â    âHave you, my boy? Why bless my life! so you have, I declare; then by  the piper that played before Moses, Iâll have a few friends to meet you,  and weâll make a day of it. Youâve never seen a nautch, I believe; weâll  have Chumbailie and Goolabie[60] and all that setâa devilled turkey, and  a glorious blow-out.â    Marpeet was as good as his word; he posted off _chits_ (invitations) to  a dozen choice spirits; ordered a fat sheep to be killed, which had been  six months on gram; bought the best ham to be had in cantonments, and a  turkey for its _vis-a-vis_; ordered half a chest of claret, and beer to  be _tundakurred_ (cooled); sent his bearer to bespeak a tip-top set of  nautch-girls, and then, slapping me on the back, exclaimed,    âNow, Frank, my boy, we are all right and tight, and your griffinage  shall close with a flourish of trumpets.â    On the following day the guests assembled at dinner, and the old mosque  resounded with the echoes of our revelry and mirth. Marpeet certainly  boxed the kansamah[61] for omitting the pigeon-pie, and ordered the cook  half a dozen rattans for underboiling the ham; but, on the whole, he was  in splendid key.    Evening at length approached; more young officers came in; the wall  shades were lighted, and chairs arranged in a semicircle; teapoys, port,  mint, claret, were all _moojood_ (present), when the curtain was rolled  up, and a bevy of as pretty gazelle-eyed damsels, arrayed in robes of  sky-blue, crimson and gold, bedecked with rings and chains, and redolent  of oil of Chumbailie, as I ever saw, entered the apartment in stately  guise, followed by sundry old duennas, and four or five rakish looking  musicians, with embroidered skull-caps, long raven ringlets, and slender  ungirdled waists, bearing some of the funniest looking musical  instruments ever seen since the days of Orpheus.    After some excruciating tuning, thrumming, and twisting of keys, a  couple of young sirens, fair Mogulanees, whose languishing eyes shone  brightly through their antimonial borders, broke forth into a song,  advancing with hands extended and slow movements of the feet, their  anklet-bells jingling harmoniously the â_goongroo ka awaz_,â by the way,  a music on which the Indian poet loves to expatiate. As the song and the  movement quickened, the heads of the fiddlers worked ecstatically,  whilst they sawed away at their outlandish fiddles with surprising  energy and vigour.    Marpeet was in raptures; he considered nautches superior to all the  operas in the universe, and thought he could hardly ever have enough of  them.    The â_Cahar ca nautch_,â or âdance of the bearer,â a favourite in India,  was now called for loudly, and the prettiest girl of the set, retiring a  little on one side, and twisting a turban saucily round her head, after  the fashion of that order of menial, and otherwise arranging her attire  into a somewhat similar resemblance to the other parts of their dress,  darted forward arms a-kimbo, _Ã  la Vestris_, and danced an animated  lilt, something of the nature of a Highland fling.    Rapturous were the âbravosâ of the officers, and the â_wau! waus!_â of  the natives. The girlâs excitement increased with the applause; the  fiddlers worked like heroes, whilst the _doog-doogie_ man, or drummer,  pegged away at his long drum, till, flushed and exhausted, she made her  salaam, and retired within the circle amidst renewed plaudits.    This was followed by â_Mootrib-i koosh_,â âsongster sweet,â and other  Persian and Hindostanee airs, not forgetting â_Sarrai teen pisa  muchlee_,â _i.e._, âthree haâporth of fish,â by way of _finale_, till at  length the dancing grew languid; the hookas bubbled faintly, and  Marpeet, starting up, dismissed the dancers, and we all adjourned to do  honour to the devilled turkeyâs legs and a saucepan of mulled port, of  Marpeetâs own brewing.    Enlivened by the change, the song and the toast went round, and Marpeet,  who was half-seas-over, sung us,           âDear Tom, this brown jug, which now foams with mild ale,â    in his very best style; and, by particular request I warbled âThe  Woodpecker.â    [Illustration: The Last Night of His Griffinage Marpeet âRoyal.â]    âFranco, your health and song, my boy,â said my friend, rising on his  legs; âand now, gentlemen (_hiccup_), I am about to propose the toast of  the evening, and one which, I am sure, youâll all drink with as much  pleasure (_hiccup_) as I have in giving it: gentlemen, off with your  heel-taps; are you all charged? Wildfire, pass the bottle. Gentlemen, I  am now about to propose the health of a young friend of mine, whom I  consider in some respects a chick of my own rearing. We came out  together, and I take credit for having made him the good fellow you all  find him (_hiccup_). This is the last day of his griffinage, and  to-morrow he is one of us old hands. Gentlemen, I give you, standing,  with three times three, long life, health, and success to our friend,  Frank Gernon, the griffin. Hip! hip! hurrah!â         Woodfall and Kinder, Printers, Milford Lane, Strand, London, W.C.    -----    Footnote 1:      The arms of the City of London supported by Griffins or Wyverns.

Footnote 13:      In this country of high-pressure morality, it may be right to explain    that the same reluctance to mingle under one roof the children    _legitimÃ¨ procreati_ with those less legally begotten does not exist    in India, where unhappily, humanity and laxity flourish together, the    reverse of what it should be, of course.

The fee is owed    to the owner of the Project Gutenbergâ¢ trademark, but he has    agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid    within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are    legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty    payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in    Section 4, âInformation about donations to the Project Gutenberg    Literary Archive Foundation.â    â¢ You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies    you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he    does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenbergâ¢    License.

If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project  Gutenbergâ¢ electronic work or group of works on different terms than  are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing  from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of  the Project Gutenbergâ¢ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set  forth in Section 3 below.    1.F.    1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable  effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread  works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project  Gutenbergâ¢ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenbergâ¢  electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may  contain âDefects,â such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate  or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other  intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or  other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or  cannot be read by your equipment.    1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the âRight  of Replacement or Refundâ described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project  Gutenbergâ¢ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project  Gutenbergâ¢ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all  liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal  fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT  LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE  PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.

LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a  defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can  receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a  written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you  received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium  with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you  with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in  lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person  or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second  opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied  warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of  damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement  violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the  agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or  limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or  unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the  remaining provisions.    1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the  trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone  providing copies of Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works in  accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the  production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenbergâ¢  electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,  including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of  the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this  or any Project Gutenbergâ¢ work, (b) alteration, modification, or  additions or deletions to any Project Gutenbergâ¢ work, and (c) any  Defect you cause.    Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergâ¢    Project Gutenbergâ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of  electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of  computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It  exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations  from people in all walks of life.    Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the  assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ¢'s  goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection will  remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure  and permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future  generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see  Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at  www.gutenberg.org    Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation    The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit  501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the  state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal  Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification  number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by  U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.    The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,  Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up  to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website  and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact    Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg  Literary Archive Foundation    Project Gutenbergâ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without  widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of  increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be  freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest  array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations  ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt  status with the IRS.    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United  States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a  considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up  with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations  where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND  DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular  state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we  have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition  against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who  approach us with offers to donate.    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make  any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from  outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.    Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation  methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other  ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To  donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate    Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works    Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project  Gutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be  freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and  distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of  volunteer support.    Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed  editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in  the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not  necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper  edition.    Most people start at our website which has the main PG search  facility: www.gutenberg.org    This website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢,  including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to  subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.  \n"
