    "The structure and size of the neural network used for fine-tuning word embeddings really depend on the specific task you're working on. However, I can provide some general suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Layer (Word Embeddings)**: The input layer will be your pre-trained word embeddings. The size of these embeddings typically ranges from 50 to 300 dimensions. For instance, GloVe provides embeddings of various dimensions, and BERT uses 768-dimensional embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hidden Layers**: The choice and number of hidden layers depend on your specific task. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For text classification, you might use one or two Dense layers after a GlobalMaxPooling or GlobalAveragePooling layer to reduce the sequence dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For sequence labeling tasks (like named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging), you could use a Bidirectional LSTM or GRU layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For more complex tasks like machine translation or question answering, you might use a stack of several LSTM/GRU layers, or even a transformer architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The size of these layers (number of units) can range widely, but common choices are in the range of 64-512 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Layer**: The output layer will depend on your specific task:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For binary classification, you would use a single unit with a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - For multi-class classification, you would use a softmax activation function with as many units as there are classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For sequence labeling, you could use a Dense layer with a softmax activation and a number of units equal to the number of labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, these are just starting points. The best structure and size for your network will depend on your specific task, your data, and the computational resources you have available. It's often a good idea to start with a simpler model and gradually add complexity as needed. Also, remember to use techniques like dropout and regularization to prevent overfitting as your model becomes more complex."
